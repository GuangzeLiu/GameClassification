X Rebirth,schinese,"作为一款优秀的太空沙盒游戏，它拥有详尽的背景设定，庞大精美却能无缝连接的地图，强大的战斗系统和多样化的战斗方式，丰富的舰船升级和改造、武器选择、舰队编成、空间站建造与升级、货物生产供应与贸易、扫描探索等诸多系统，以及许多非常有意思的细节。[spoiler] (看到太空高速公路系统仿佛有一种回到自由枪骑兵时代的错觉，恍惚间就已经过去十多年了)[/spoiler]
与此同时这也造成了这款游戏上手难度较高，对于从未接触过这类游戏的玩家来说恐怕需要很长时间才能熟悉各项基本系统，而更为复杂的空间站&货物系统则需要数十小时甚至更多时间才能掌握，因此建议新手玩家先完成教程(战役模式)再进入自由模式。
目前正式版本为4.10，探索、战斗、贸易等各项功能已经基本趋于完善，曾经诸多影响正常游戏的BUG也已被修复，然而遗憾的是依然无法更换座驾，任务系统也并未得到扩展。
顺带一提目前已有非常丰富的MOD，诸如舰桥、自动贸易、船员自动升级、宇宙全面战争等优秀MOD可以极大的丰富游戏性，使得游戏后期不再枯燥无味。",

Sid Meier's Civilization V,japanese,"Civ初心者の感想です。動画などを見てセールで買って触ってみたけれど、要素が多すぎるし長丁場で展開がグダグダになっちゃう、と何となく避けていました。

ですが、今になってふと、戦争ゲームしたいな...と思って、とりあえず慣れるために、酋長パンゲア1対1での古典ぐらいでの勝利からはじめて、将軍パンゲア極小でルネッサンスぐらいでの制覇勝利と続き、今は皇子大陸小マップ6文明で遊んでいます。こうやって徐々に規模を大きくして慣らしていくと遊びやすかったです。

制覇勝利を目標と決めていたものの、最初は全文明を殲滅するプレイでよかったのですが、難易度を上げて文明数を増やすと、軍事ばかりだと内政で遅れを取ったり、内政ばかりで軍備を疎かにすると首都を落とされたり、金銭や幸福度の問題に直面したり、攻め過ぎで外交にペナルティがついたり、といろいろな問題に直面することになります。これに最初は失敗して敗北しつつも、対処法を考えて次に活かして勝利する、その過程が面白いです。

最初は考えることを減らすためにパンゲアでやっていましたが、大陸マップでこそゲームの要素を全て味わえる感じですね。最初は領土確保の競争をし、次に国防をしながら内政基盤を整え、大陸が見渡せたら外交戦略を練って、しかるべきときに仕掛けて勢力を広げる。自大陸を制圧した頃には大航海時代が訪れて、海の向こうでは大きく育った新文明と出会う...。そういう山あり谷ありの展開になるんですよね。

ここまで来て、やっぱりCivってよくできてるな、と思いました。",

選ばれた作品ということもありかなりいいできです。
しかし、あえてここでsteam版を購入する意味は？
という辺りでお勧めしないでおきます。
普通に遊ぶだけいいのであれば、または、実績などの成果をもとめない限りでは
原作やPlayismの無料版をダウンロードしてプレイすればいいと思います。

現在通常ルート一回り、いろいろ実績解除しながら一回り中という感じです。
真のエンディング目指してノーマルでプレイ中..という感じです。
二周目で狙う予定だったけどうっかり条件クリア前にやってしまったので..
アクションは自分では得意と感じたことない程度の腕前なので
華麗に攻略とかはできない感じです。

洞窟物語の名前は正直なところあんまりしらなかったです。
海外でも評価が高いメジャーなタイトルみたいですね。
これは海外版ですが基本同じものなんだろうと思います。

日本語にも対応しているようですがボスを倒したときの実績が対応してないなどの問題もあるようです。

Banished,schinese,"作为一款打折后不到20块，本体只有178M的模拟建造类游戏来说，已经十分出色了。与其他模拟经营类游戏（比如某天际省）不同，该作最大的区别主要是没有经济系统，全部以物换物，从把让玩家带入一个“开局一群人，其他全靠造”的，一个模拟一群人在仅有的工具和资源的条件下，在一片野外白手起家的故事，有点中世纪开垦新家园的历史感觉。然而缺点也是很明显，便是极其新手劝退的难度。资源之间的关联度极其高，一旦一个环节出错便会全部崩盘，而且本体里面人口老龄化所占的比重也是相当的大，石头和矿产这些建造必需品又是有限的，因此开局的坑相当的多。由于是15年的游戏，许多该作的爱好者已经开发出了6个版本的升级版（截止到该评测日期），极大地丰富了剧情和玩法，因此对该游戏感兴趣，而且已经通关了本体的玩家，不妨可以去试一试。此外，创意工坊也有许多MOD，但是该游戏打了MOD就解锁不了成就（包括汉化MOD），汉化的MOD创意工坊就有。MOD之间会冲突导致报错，因此我只玩了本体。下面写一下我发展遇到的坑，具体的可以参阅社区里面的指南，里面写的比较详细。

我是困难开局，关闭了灾难（一开始熟悉流程的话最好先别开，[spoiler] 虽然开了都不一定撑得到灾难来[/spoiler]）温和天气，地图中。

开局首先设置一下物品上限，我的习惯是木石铁燃料之类的资源2000，食物8000，啤酒100，工具衣服150，其他150-200.然后左上角放城镇综合数据框，左下角放分配工作的框（便于及时分配工作），右上角放地图。

第一个坑就是第一个冬天：开局首先起一个料堆，挖一片树和石头，然后起2个木房子，接着一个伐木场和2个采集小屋。这些刁民的工作都是十分不积极，必须要在冬天来之前把上述建筑盖好，建议使用优先级工具不停地框选。

然后就分配4个人到采集小屋里，1个人进伐木场打柴火，剩下来的砍树收集石头，留1-2个建筑工其他的盖木房。

这里简述一下游戏里的食物单位。采集小屋是最稳定的来源，一个采集小屋里每放一个人一年能产出300左右的食物，渔夫小屋一个人只能产100的鱼，猎人小屋看脸，欧的时候年产量试过每人300-500的鹿肉，但是脸黑的时候甚至会是0.因此困难开局由于没牲口没种子种地，前期只能靠采集小屋。

关于游戏里面的建筑单位。该作是这么设计的，所有带有圆圈的建筑单位（各种食物小屋，护林小屋，草药屋之类的），意思有2个：1，圆圈划定的范围便是工作范围 2，圆圈要是有建筑单位那么会对产量造成影响 3，范围内要是有同类单位那么产量会衰减。 因此，该游戏的建筑布置策略：各个类型的建筑不必挤的太紧，前期可以找一片区域专门起住房，一片区域专门起采集小屋（按照圆圈范围相切分布），狩猎小屋和渔夫小屋也分开。总之就是铺的开一些。

接上，起了2个采集小屋以后建议可以再补一个，然后就是再收集一些石头和木头先找个深山老林把药草小屋起了（该建筑需要老树，因此专门找个地方尽量别砍这一片的树。）药草小屋里面需要放一个巫医（就算药草达到上限了都不要解职这个巫医不然药草没用。）接着就是护林小屋，找两片树林往中间一插就完事，一屋一人。然后就是补齐渔夫小屋和猎人小屋，虽然这俩食物产量不高，但是有各自的作用。猎人小屋前期主要是起皮革，而且偶尔也会丰收鹿肉。渔夫小屋的鱼主要是增加营养健康度，有闲人可以扔进去。（PS：如果河道比较窄的话渔夫小屋甚至可以当木桥使。）

然后就是路桥洞。首先涵洞这玩意没必要，因为虽然路修不过去，你的刁民是可以从山头上面直接走过去的，修建又要那么多材料，前期肯定不划算。木桥还是需要的，连接被河流分开的大陆。基本上2-3个桥就够了。

在这个阶段因为还没那么多建筑，因此可以收集一些石头和铁。接着就是满足所有人的房屋需求。前期木房，后面石头多了可以考虑石头房子。

接着就是起1个仓库，裁缝店和铁匠铺。这里就是这个游戏的第二个大坑。所有人工作都需要工具，如果没有工具的话效率只有4分之一，然而造工具需要开采木头和铁矿，因此一旦工具没了大概率就是直接GG。因此工具的数量要时刻注意。在这里把所有需要时刻注意的资源说了吧：食物（前期50人以下少于1000就增加采集小屋的人吧），柴火（再少不能少于50），工具也是50。

后面我的玩法就是出集市（当仓库用，小贩可以做搬运工便于物资流通，一个区域的集市放1-2个小贩进去），接着就是教堂（保幸福度），市政厅+招待所+贸易站。关于这仨建筑，主要是接收流民。就算人口老龄化死绝了，只要有这三件套，然后采集小屋伐木场啥的配套设施都在，来一波流民就能复活。贸易站放一个人在里面。

关于贸易，该游戏的硬通货（4种类型商人都接受的商品）主要是，柴火衣服和工具（前期不太可能富余铁煤石头这些建造必备资源，有的都拿来盖房子了）。因此贸易站里可以设置预留一些柴火（我一般写800个），因为种子和牲口就靠商人运过来了，前期由于资源吃紧，首先就是买种子和牲口，其他的暂时不买。

关于种植。分为农作物和果树两类。果树的话种植以后需要第二年的秋天才能收获，当成食物来源的话产量不是特别理想，主要作用是酿酒（缺木头倒是可以砍了应急）。农作物的话，小麦种子可以酿酒，因此优先考虑。此外土豆貌似产量比其他高一点（心理作用？）因此我喜欢买土豆种子。然而种子需要3125个货币单位（虽然这游戏没货币），一个柴火算4，这就是为什么我放800个。种植大小的话前期建议7*8左右，每块田放一个农夫就好。有了种子以后起6-8块田就可以把之前其他食物单位的人解放出来（采集小屋，渔夫狩猎这些），15块田可以坚持到约100个人了。

关于农场。等商人运了牲口过来再建也不是太迟，可以买了先放在交易站里，但是不能放太久。牲口主要有3种，鸡牛羊。鸡繁殖的最快，最便宜，500一只，可以下蛋，纯食用价值。羊600一只，可以薅羊毛做衣服。牛的话800一只，可以提供皮革。农场的话越大能装的动物就越多，放一个人进去即可。有了羊或者牛的话衣服就不缺了。

该游戏还有一个机制就是工作效率。刁民工作到一半会去寻找食物，取暖（有衣服的话会好一点），寻找药草治病，休息。此外就是工作地点离房子越远效率就越低。因此发展策略就是每一片土地（以水为界）都下一个集市（流通食物工具等货物，不然全都跑去初始地方拿，时间全浪费在路上），一个料堆（中转建筑材料），一些房屋（取暖用），铁匠铺+伐木场和一些食物来源。基本上就是一片区域把必备的房子，工具，和其他配套单位起了以后先去下一个区域一方面的扩张另一方面是采集下一个区域的资源。

关于建房子的节奏，建议是每隔一年建一个新房屋。此外就是不要一段时间内建造大量的建筑，保证木头工具这些充足，一个一个的建造，不然资源链条容易断裂。保证年龄比例在一个合理的范围内。接受流民之前考虑好你的食物和工具供给是否充足。

关于人口。人口来源主要靠生。其次就是流民（但是可能会带来传染病，虽然我没遇到。）因此人口结构十分重要。

还有一个就是学校，在起了贸易站后推荐起一个，因为受过教育的居民工作效率更高。接着后面就是找点地方起煤矿和采石场。由于这俩单位会废地，因此建议后期石头煤矿和铁全靠商人进口（全部拿加工后的货去换，多生产些柴火，羊毛大衣啥的）。

还有个东西就是墓地，死人多了起墓地可以恢复幸福度。此外啤酒也可以提高幸福度，可以拿任意果树产的果子酿，小麦也可以酿。水井每个区域起一个防火灾。然后就是每次大的变动（比如扩张或者接收流民）之前勤存档。此外也可以存档刷商人（前期刷羊和种植业的种子）。再往后就是保证供应链条不断裂情况下照着这个模式无尽发展下去了。我的感觉是学校大概每50人起一个，每多10个人起一块小田，每一块地配套一个伐木场+铁匠铺然后保证这些关键设施的供应（比如原木和铁），就能稳定发展下去。

总之这是一个十分有趣的游戏，在这里分享一下自己的心得，想要认真玩的可以去网上看一看大佬的攻略。[spoiler] 我这个菜鸡在100多人时候接了一波流民直接搞光了工具，又没存档，直接GG，心累。[/spoiler]",

这游戏可是真良心，一直在更新。从一开始的本体免费追加了4个dlc。剧情彩蛋内容丰富，而且bgm相当好听。主线推腻了打打牌，牌打腻了打打乱斗，玩玩打靶或者挑战小游戏。

这里不得不佩服下作者团队用的8-BIT像素风的制作技术。像这样的复古神作。我知道的就只有 传说之下 和 蔚蓝 能和它相提并论了。期待铲子续作！

Darkest Dungeon®,schinese,"断断续续玩了好久，一共从头开了三次档，最后还是靠着cheat engine通关的。本作是我玩过的硬核rogue-like游戏里机制最丰富的游戏之一，重复劳动和探索新内容之间交替，既缓和了开门杀，又不至于枯燥。

本作的前期体验非常轻松有趣，英雄等级不算高，地图不算太大，怪物不算太强，机制限制不算太多，可以很快就吸引浅尝辄止的玩家，而一旦入了坑就难以自拔。然而到了中期，难度曲线立刻变得陡峭，培养英雄的成本随着地牢难度提高而增加，从前可以随便招募一个英雄去打低级本，但是现在必须培养到三级之后才能挑战中级本。同时资源也变得拮据起来，想要提高英雄的实力就要花费大量的地牢战利品，挑战地牢也有一定的维护成本，也就是说正常的玩法就是匍匐前进步步为营。在地牢里一步走错就意味着不得不撤退，既没获得战利品有需要花费资源维护英雄，赔了夫人又折兵。如果铤而走险，作为一个rogue-like游戏也还是相对看重运气的，不小心英雄牺牲的话就意味着前面大量努力成了泡影。同时地牢本身也有一定难度，中级英雄打中级本远远比不上低级英雄打低级本来的轻松。这也就是游戏硬核的不好玩之处了，机制再多也还是有限，每个地图里两个boss对应两个机制，但他们后续升级并不会扩增新机制。地牢小怪大同小异，熟悉之后也能够做到针对。还有互动物品等，这些都是可以通过查攻略来减少大量走弯路的时间，但即使如此，在了解完全部机制的游戏后期就比较枯燥而严格了。这恐怕是硬核rogue-like的通病了。

我没研究过英雄之间搭配的套路，之前不作弊玩的时候也没有使用过新英雄，对其不做评价。dlc一共两个或者说一个半地牢，无尽村庄连环打怪已经没有地牢迷宫的味道了。猩红宫廷难度高的离谱，我开修改都觉得难度失控了。岔路过多，还要满图找钥匙，最难受的是嗜血病机制，互相传染，必须适量补血，强度相当于变式怪癖吧，但是随机性太高了。精英（鳄鱼）和boss必须查攻略，否则必定全军覆没。我理解设计者想让玩家查攻略，但是如果不查攻略完全没有乐趣可言的话，这样的游戏设计就是在强奸轻度玩家。

最令我诧异的是这个游戏居然连续上了psv和switch两部掌机，甚至还有ios？？？我是想不出抱着移动端玩这个游戏得肝到猴年马月，以及有多少人能通关了。也许后面难度做的低一些，就能有超过5%的玩家能够体验结局了。当然这个游戏本身也不是剧情驱动，玩到一半弃游也不会令人给出差评。相对的，这个硬核反而能成为噱头更好地进行宣传。不过我们这种挂逼就不在乎了。cheat engine, yyds.",yyds

Torment: Tides of Numenera,schinese,"经过三周目的体验达到全成就之后，我对本作有了些许改观，总的来说，本作继承了PST对游戏世界的细致刻画，虽然效果并不是那么好。此外，如果不是游戏最后对主要冲突的解决过于儿戏的话，剧情本来是可以很丰富的，游戏里的两大主要区域Sagus Cliffs和The Bloom的内容其实并不少，但是绝大部分都是支线内容，这很明显是在一开始设计任务路线的时候就出了问题。私以为盲目地将本作搞成全平台发售的公司高层绝对是脑子有病，因为照顾主机平台的手柄操作，本作的战斗系统彻底成了噩梦，将绝大部分喜欢RPG战斗元素的玩家排除在了目标群体之外，属实作茧自缚。

本来20年前玩过PST的玩家都快要从黑发变成白发了，凭兴趣去玩年龄和自己接近的游戏的年轻玩家是少之又少，搞不清目标群体的需求造成经费没有用到刀刃上，最终将本作弄成了PST的一个拙劣继承者，白费了Numenera这么一个非常有意思的背景设定。反而从纯粹的文学和TRPG角度制作的Disco Elysium被媒体宣传为PST的精神续作，实在是造化弄人。


下面是原来的一周目评测
——————————————分割线——————————————

作为众筹金额创纪录的PST”精神”续作而言，有点名不副实，更确切的说是虎头蛇尾。从游戏流程的设计上能看出本作和PST有着非常多的相似点，但是细细对照起来却发现很多地方经不起推敲。

下面我具体解释一下TTON的失败之处，单纯走主线的话TTON的游戏时间可能10小时都不到，这对一个CRPG游戏来说是个巨大的灾难。因为本作继承了PST的游玩风格，全程基本可以对话推进，导致没有任何障碍阻止玩家直奔主题，虽然本作的目标群体都是探索支线为主的，但是主线的单薄注定这个游戏是个失败之作。就拿前辈PST来做个对比，Sagus Cliffs对应Sigil，Miel Avest对应Ravel’s Maze, The Bloom对应The Curst，然后游戏在The Bloom之后戛然而止，导致玩家觉得终于可以放开手脚大干一场的时候突然游戏就结束了，可以说两者后期都有缩水赶工的情况。更为遗憾的是，PST在后期赶工的情况下仍然完成了对 “What can change the nature of a man?” 的解答，而TTON却并没有解答 “What does one life matter?”这一剧情的核心问题。剧情的最后Last castoff和The Sorrow对质时，讨论的问题甚至可以说和核心问题没有关系，这让我感到无所适从，甚至有点生气。仔细一想，改变人的本性和生命的意义何在确实在问题的重量级上不一样，不过中国有句古话说得好，没有金刚钻，不揽瓷器活。既然制作组选择抛出这种问题，就应该想好怎样从各种角度诠释问题的答案，而不是到了故事的最后丢下问题草草了事，虽然在很多支线过程中能体会到不同的角色对生命的态度，但是问题在于玩家选择的并不是对核心问题的解答。此外，PST中的派系多并且设定合理，TTON中绝大多数派系都是The Changing God创造的，这让人非常的无语，并且TTON的支线看起来也没有PST多，从各种角度来说，TTON都没有达到PST的水平，实在是担不起精神续作之名。

和同为众筹的永恒之柱1相比，TTON如同一个半成品，我不知道Inxile讨饭组是怎么花这个钱的，引擎用的是柱子的，筹的钱比柱子多，最后却得到这种结果。众筹时我还在上大学，没能力出大钱，现在想来没有希望就没有失望，除了无能狂怒喷喷Inxile还能咋办。

最后的最后，对于喜欢文本丰富剧情有深度的这类游戏的玩家来说，TTON还算可以，抛开那时常出现的故弄玄虚的行文风格的话，纯看文本个人认为能打70分，和PST以及最近的Disco Elysium比还是强人所难，不过想来这种看原文的游戏也不会引起多大波澜，毕竟文学才是追求文本丰富剧情有深度的最终归宿。既然如此，去看看James Joyce, Marcel Proust或者Franz Kafka也许是个不错的主意。",cliffsHe  Xia Mian Shi Yuan Lai De Yi Zhou Mu Ping Ce Fen Ge Xian  avestDui Ying ravels maze bloomDui Ying  curstRan Hou You Xi Zai  what can change nature a man De Jie Da Er ttonQue Bing Mei You Jie Da  what does one life matterZhe Yi Ju Qing De He Xin Wen Ti Ju Qing De Zui Hou last castfHe  changing joyce marcel proustHuo Zhe franz kafkaYe Xu Shi Ge Bu Cuo De Zhu Yi

Broforce,schinese,"军团武装（好像是叫这个名字？不过我找的汉化叫兄贵军团）这个游戏是一个很简单很爽快的横版闯关游戏
可操作的角色类型很多，每个都有不同的玩法特点，非常好评（但是有时候会像赌狗一样抽不到自己喜欢用的角色）
17个小时里不记得多少时间是挂卡了，单人玩了一段时间，好玩但略微有些自闭的感觉在，不如联机一起玩有意思
后七个小时是和女票一起玩的，场面一度十分混乱，突然暴毙更是家常便饭，脸接子弹熟练的很
一个人也不杀一路跑酷的玩法也尝试过，成功的时候会觉得很爽，扔下队友自己上直升机的感觉就更爽了
听说群里四人联机过，直接炸的连前面的路都没了，hhhhh确实很适合作为一个聚会游戏，很有游戏特色，也很解压

说下缺点，我和女票两个人都十分喜欢这游戏前40%的内容，也就是普通的对抗恐怖势力的部分（话说我没分清到底是对面是恐怖势力还是我自己是恐怖势力）
游戏后期的外星势力甚至魔法势力都及其没有代入感，总之感觉有点变味，不是很喜欢
也就导致了玩到80%的进度不太想玩了
但是这是个人因素，不影响整体的好评，特别是前期，特别欢乐，价格不贵，推荐购买",

Salt and Sanctuary,schinese,"8-8.5分

先说缺点：非常后期有一点跳跳乐（我天火教懒得跳了），而且作为掉落会掉血容易摔死的游戏，一些地方看不到下一层只能闭眼往下跳很恶心；至于一些人觉得某些地方极限横斜跳不上的问题我反而没感觉到，按好方向键就可以。

这游戏只是数值系统，尤其剧情和属性道具分类比较魂，总体冒险感和场景是偏银河城的，恶魔城和魂爱好者都非常推荐，反正现在折扣后很低。15块你买不到吃亏上当。照魂来单方向加点，一周目一路平推没什么难度，只是可能会漏个别物品或者任务而已。

"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III",schinese,"游戏发售已经过了一年半了，对于曾经开发商那些令人智熄的操作，也已经渐渐可以平静对待了。
所以，我特意再来体验一次这款游戏，抛却那些成见，思考一下它到底是不是一个合格的游戏。

战锤40k战争黎明3安装
不到10小时
战锤40k战争黎明3卸载

来吧！下面批评大会开始！

我把这款游戏的失败总结为两点，一个是决策上的失误，一个是设计上的问题。

决策上的失误是开发商根本不明白他们游戏吸引人的地方在哪。

前作是RTT游戏，而本作变成了RTS。同一个系列的游戏改变游戏类型，这么干本身就是自杀行为。这意味着前作积累的粉丝肯定有很大一部分人不能适应新游戏，虽然RTT和RTS看起来属于同一大类，但是其实操作起来区别还是不小的。RTT远没有RTS这么繁琐，不用给大一堆乱七八糟的部队编队，也不用打着架还要顾着家里造兵，这个游戏类型直接就劝退一部分人。

另一个大问题是游戏不忠于原作。
既然游戏是以战锤为名，那就必须符合战锤的世界观，而这款游戏，也许最符合世界观的部分就是宣传片了。（宣传片真的好看，我可以再看一万遍）
这款游戏过分追求“平衡性”，而把每个种族都设置了同样数目的兵种，然后让每个兵种都能在其他种族里找到战斗力相匹配的，但问题在于，这些兵种在战锤世界观里战斗力并不一样，为了保证游戏平衡性，而得罪战锤粉丝，这么做值得么？

同样，这个剧情也一点不战锤，我想大部分战锤粉丝都想看到一个“有忠诚，有黑暗”的符合战锤世界观的剧情，而不是现在这个，这个好莱坞爆米花电影情节。当然，也许他们原本想要在DLC中尽兴发挥，但这游戏凉的太透彻，DLC永远也见不到了。

从游戏具体设计上来看，也是相当失败的。

首先游戏的操作很难受，时时刻刻都像陷进泥沼一样，体型越大的延迟越大。
如果自己操作的单位被眩晕了，会取消之前操作的指令，等眩晕时间过去之后，单位会起身冲向敌人，拦都拦不住。

战役关没有策咯可言，只要不停造兵然后派他们去送死就行，开局一定打不过，后期一定能耗死。
单人战役可以明显看出根本就没有细心做，游戏的重心完全放在了多人模式。

那么再来看多人模式。
很遗憾的是，游戏已经鬼服了，我现在已经无从体验与人对战的乐趣，也没法考证游戏的平衡性如何。

不过，从游戏的多样性来说，它合格了，几乎每一个兵种都有不同的作用，只要看到那些不同的技能，就能想到很多种策咯和战斗方式。
游戏里的技能非常强，遍地都是纯粹伤害，一个技能直接秒杀一群小兵是很正常的，这让它不会变成一个F2A的游戏。
以巧妙的方式释放技能和躲技能是非常有趣的，在做出精彩操作的时候，也会有一种成就感。
至少在这个游戏里，能体验到RTS游戏的乐趣，它复杂，值得思考。

很可惜，仅存的这些优点不能拯救这款游戏。

很久以前就听说过战锤系列，但是苦于各种原因无法玩耍，毕竟桌游自己玩不太好，而且也成本也高，当初玩过爱心分享版的战争黎明2后来因为这种操作模式不习惯就删除了，后来也不知道怎么就如入了世嘉那个大包。后来看见战争黎明3要出，预购奖励还那么炫，我不管，灵能族的那个皮肤最好看，然后就直接预购，结果测试的时候我就失望了，优化不足，服务器差，当时海豚加速器是在测试的时候免费加速，就这样还是高延迟高掉包，如果不挂加速器连人都匹配不到，后来就扔深处等一波波的更新，现在到好，开发商都觉得救不活就永久停止更新，emmmm虽然我知道刚发售的时候一群自喊老粉丝的刷差评说剧情不满意，但当时看你们发出各种版本更新，还在期待未来更好的体验版本，结果这就溜了,游戏性还可以，并不至于因为剧情不行操作不行就给差评，战锤40K这种题材本身就是这种小队的操作模式，我没感觉跟2代的操作差异太多，至于剧情emmmm确实是有点仓促，看个人吧，如果是喜欢这种类型的或者喜欢战锤40K的打折75%只要44，买来自己打战役或者跟好友互打也是个不错的选择，至于现在掉到这价格，其实玩游戏不就是这样，没必要因为贬值了点钱就给差评，不值当",

Titan Souls,schinese,"这是一个需要耐心的游戏。
一般每次死后所花的赶路时间不超过十秒，有些人觉得这是个很大的缺点，但我不这么认为。除了初见BOSS时的那几次常常会惨死，只要了解了它们，存活个把分钟是很容易的，困难的是如何摸索到弱点并抓住机会进行击杀。相对于每次的挑战时间，几秒钟的跑路我认为完全可以接受。如果你觉得跑路的时间很长而挑战时间很短，那我觉得你对这个BOSS还是知之甚少，用这几秒钟平复一下心情，思考一下它的移动/攻击模式以及如何应对，而不是一味地莽，应该会很有帮助。
顺便提几个小tip：
1.推荐用手柄玩。游戏是从PS4上移植的，所以手柄体验最佳。键盘操作难度直接上升一个档次。
2.打完前四个BOSS进入的第二张地图里，一共有12个BOSS，只要解决7个就能进入下一个场景（如果要挑战最后的BOSS-TRUTH的话是要全解决掉的），有的BOSS需要一点运气，所以可以考虑跳过，尤其是在多周目的各种受苦模式下。
3.想全成就的话可以考虑一下S/L大法。存档位置是*\Steam\steamapps\common\Titan Souls\data\SAVE，那几个txt文件就是存档（真是耿直的作者2333）。二十分钟通关、困难通关和无翻滚通关的成就我是正常做的，一命通关犯懒读了几次档，困难难度一命通关以及一命挑战所有BOSS就全靠存档了_(:з”∠)_要是没有S/L和SAM大法，我觉得可能只有0.1%玩家能全成就…",Zhe Shi Yi Ge Xu Yao Nai Xin De You Xi  Shun Bian Ti Ji Ge Xiao tip
Titan Souls,japanese,"[b]このゲームは弓で狙う角度を細かく調整できないとゲーム性が大きく損なわれるため、アナログコントローラーがほぼ必須かなと思います。（公式でも強く推奨しています）[/b]

自分よりデカくて重いボス（体当たりや押しつぶしは当たればもちろん即死）の弱点を弓で射る、言ってしまえばそれだけのゲーム。
ボスはそれぞれ個性的で、激しい攻撃で弱点を狙う暇を与えてくれなかったり、攻撃の合間の僅かな一瞬しか弱点を見せなかったり、特定の条件を満たさないと弱点を露出しない奴などいろいろ居て、攻略にはひらめきと正確な操作が要求されます。倒し方がわかった後もアクションに結構手こずったりもするので、難易度は結構高めです。初見だけはゲボ吐くほど難しく感じます（さらに、高難易度モードや一部実績は鬼）。ひらめいて、狙って、撃って、当たった時は快感！（弱点に当てさえすれば、ボスは一撃で倒せます）

ボス戦主体で、弱点に辿り着くまでの過程やひらめきに重点をおいたゲームデザイン、ボスを倒した時の演出、言葉による説明がほとんどないことによる独特の雰囲気、妙にだだっ広いマップの各地に点在するボスなど、「ワンダと巨像」からかなり大きな影響を受けているように見受けられました。（あと、ハガレン？）雰囲気ゲーと見せかけた硬派な死に覚えアクションゲームといった趣です。ワンダが好きな人なら同様に楽しめると思います。

上級モードに手を出さなければプレイ時間としてはそう長くありませんが、中身の濃いゲーム体験になることは請け合い。個人的には目指せ20分クリアのスピードランが楽しくて実績取得後も何度もやってます。[b]若干地味ながらも、歯応えのあるゲームを求めている人にオススメできる良作です。[/b]

Axiom Verge,tchinese,"《Axiom Verge，公理邊緣》是一款 8bit 像素風格的 Metroidvania 類型遊戲，玩家為一位名叫 Trace 的科學家，在一次實驗意外中陷入昏迷，醒來卻發現身處在充滿未知科技與怪物的異世界。以異星探險的主軸來看，遊戲整體很有《銀河戰士》的風格，不過這款不論在劇情或內容上都完全有自己的風格，道具設計和關卡、劇情的配合也是前所未見的。遊戲融合了科幻、古文明、神話、現實、虛擬等主題，編織出一部科幻大片，這款的劇情若要拍成電影，完全是沒問題的，遊戲的主線完成的故事，跟挖掘出全部歷史文件，拼湊出來的故事有著驚人的反轉，如果你是一個「五歲抬頭」的觀眾，相信也會對這款的內容有著濃厚的興趣。

這款為什麼要叫《公理邊緣》呢？這要從它的故事說起，不過為了不劇透，關於劇情的部分這裡會跳過，可能會因此看不懂，但等你玩遊戲後就能拼湊起來，遊戲中所指的公理，基本上可以理解為宇宙萬法、宇宙法則，凡參透公理者就某種程度上猶如神般的存在，有點像悟道成仙的感覺。而邊緣呢？我們常會說遊走法律邊緣，是指在法律規則的範圍內行看似作弊的行為，用這個意思來看公理邊緣，我們就可以理解出，參透公理，依宇宙萬法行如神般的行為，穿越？讓假的成真？讓真的為假？何為現實？何為虛擬？世界究竟是真實的？還是虛擬的？這就要玩家自行理解或參透了。

遊戲介紹的最後一段很有意思：
Life. Afterlife. Real. Virtual. Dream. Nightmare. It's a thin line.
「今生、來世；現實，虛擬；夢境，夢魘。只在一線之隔。」

[u]『H・R・ギーガー』の世界観をドット絵に落とし込んだような表現が特徴的なメトロイドヴァニア系横スクロールアクション[/u]。

研究所での事故の後、不気味な異界の惑星で目覚めた主人公『Trace』 。この危険な惑星から脱出すべく、『Trace』の冒険が始まるのだった。

[h1][b]----------------------【良い点】----------------------[/b][/h1]

[h1]不気味な世界と物語[/h1]
◆ レトロスタイルなドット絵で表現された不気味な世界は圧巻の一言。
生物の様な蠢く壁、恐ろしい機械生命体達、施設の様な閉鎖的な空間だけではなく、地上に出ればサボテンの様な形の異界の植物を目にすることもできる。

民俗音楽的でメランコリックな旋律のBGMも今作の雰囲気を醸し出すのに一役買っている。
ストーリーもまた、大筋は語られるものの、物語の背景はプレイヤーに想像の余地を与えている点も個人的には良かった。



[h1]探索要素とアップグレード[/h1]
◆ 下記する複数の武器はもちろんの事、主人公の探索可能な範囲を広げてくれる、移動能力を強化する数々のアップグレードアイテムが今作では用意されている。

これらのアイテムの幾つかは所持していなくてもクリア自体は可能だが、発見できれば攻略の大きな助けになる事だろう。


ゲーム進行の為に必要になるアイテムだと、所謂『ハイジャンプ』や『グラップリングフック』等の他のメトロイドヴァニア系で良く見かけるものから、『敵や一部の物体をバグらせる武器』『壁をすり抜けるようになる研究服』等と今作オリジナルのモノも入手できる。

『HPアップ』『攻撃力アップ』『攻撃の射程、有効範囲アップ』系のアイテムももちろんあるので、上記した移動系能力をある程度入手してからは、それらを探してマップを探索する楽しみが一気に上昇する。



[h1]ボリューム[/h1]
◆ 難易度ノーマルで初回クリアまで8時間程だったが、このタイプのゲームになれていなかったり、道に迷う等で少しクリアまでの時間は変わりそうだ。

筆者がプレイした際は未入手のアイテムや未踏破のエリアが結構残っており、その点でもボリュームは十分にある。

ハードモードでのクリア、「アイテム入手率40％以下でクリア」等の実績もあるのでやり込み要素も豊富だ。



[h1]戦闘とボス戦[/h1]
◆ 今作の大きな特徴として、探索する事で発見できる隠された複数の武器、厳密には撃ち出す弾の種類、が多く用意されている。

これらを切り替えながらステージを探索していくのだが、戦闘に仕えるものから、特定の仕掛けを起動する為に使用するもの等、用途は多岐にわたる。


攻撃でいうのなら『壁を貫通する攻撃』や『敵を追尾する攻撃』があるので、状況によって使い分けることで敵をノーダメージで撃破していく事も可能だ。
また、ノーマルでも今作のボス戦はそこそこ難しく、手応えのあるものになっている。こちらもやはり、特定の武器を上手く活用する事で戦闘が一気に楽になったりと戦略的にも面白い。



[h1][b]----------------------【悪い点】----------------------[/b][/h1]

[h1]移動が面倒[/h1]
◆ 移動は基本的に徒歩で、ショートカットを使用して行うのだが、探索可能なエリアが多い終盤は移動が少し面倒になってくる。
他の方も指摘しているが、セーブポイント間のワープが可能でも良かった。



[h1]迷いやすい[/h1]
◆ こちらは悪い点と言うほどではないのだが、今作は現在よくある『ヒント』が出てくるタイプのゲームではないので、入手した能力を『何処で使用するのか』『どのように使用するのか』はプレイヤーが考えなくてはならない。

慣れていないと結構道に迷う事になる。だが、これはメトロイドヴァニア系の楽しみの一つとも言えるだろう。



[h1][b]-----------------------【総評】----------------------[/b][/h1]

一言で言うなら、個人的には神ゲーだった。世界観、戦闘、探索、BGM共に素晴らしい出来で、これを開発者がほぼ一人で制作したというのだから驚きだ。

メトロイドヴァニア系を始めてプレイされるという方も、このジャンルが好きな方も間違いなくやっておくべきゲームだろう。

[h1]以下涉及剧透，请注意[/h1]









     首先游戏中的世界Sudra是虚构的，地球Earth也是。

     Breach是Sudra世界远古文明留下的机器，可以分割世界，无法强行通过，游戏中的体现就是马赛克方块，玩家必须使用地址枪和地址炸弹来修复来通过，换个说法就是游戏中可通行方块被替换成了不可通行的特殊方块，修改了原始方块的地址。

     Rusalka是战争机器水仙女，Sudra居民叫她们Kuliltu (在神话中指鱼身女人脸的生物，游戏中也可以看到三个出现的水仙女的完整身体是鱼 虾 鱿鱼的形状)

     一开始在Sudra文明极其发达，有再生克隆技术的RebirthChamber，操纵现实世界的机器Breach，以及有着超高智能的强大的士兵-水仙女Rusalka.水仙女可以漂浮在Sudra天空之上

     但是经过无数次战争，Sudra世界产生了文明断层,

     文明回到了神秘宗教时代，居民把古老机器(old machine),也就是RebirthChamber当做神的产物来崇拜，同时也觉得过去的文明过于危险而不使用

     文明自我封闭，祭祀使用Breach 封锁了天空进行自我保护，而天空正是水仙女活跃的地方。因为被认为是战争机器,不能自由活动的水仙女大部分被摧毁了,只有极少数苟活了下来，他们也明白     一但解除Breach ，好战本性的水仙女将无法被阻止。

     在地球上,Athetos因为实验爆炸半身瘫痪双目失明，但是同时让他可以冷静思考物理理论，得出突破性的成果，但是被认为是伪科学。不过在同伴Dr. Hammond帮助下得以实现，通过 地址修改 来到了Sudra的Breach。

     也就是，根据得出的公理，Sudra和地球都是虚构的世界。通过地址修改来到了Sudra。

     Athetos使用古老机器RebirthChamber完全修复了自我，同时制造了多个自己的克隆人分工帮助，来了解Sudra惊人的古老科技，并感叹这种科技同样不该被带回地球。

     为了重新获得自由水仙女们策划摧毁Sudra文明，Ophelia制造出了一种病原体，使得Sudra居民大量死亡.

     不想解除Athetos的Sudra与当地居民立场一致，和水仙女Katrahaska试图阻止其他水仙女的原始计划(Katrahaska，很可能就是其他水仙女提到的外来者Drushka，作为水仙女和Sudra居民的中立派)。

     由于Athetos和Katrahaska的介入，水仙女逐渐处于劣势，几乎完全被消灭，相对Katrahaska也被水仙女杀死，Athetos的瘟疫隔离装置也被破坏，只要等待能源耗尽，没有供能和修复机器人的水仙女将被完全消灭。

     但是水仙女通过欺骗快被瘟疫消灭的Sudra女祭司，允许水仙女使用RebirthChamber。
她们开始了Plan B:利用Athetos刚来Sudra的DNA记录，复制出了一个年轻的Athetos，也就是玩家Trace。

     虽然她们觉得希望渺茫，但是至少要让计划有趣（疯狂）一点。

     她们使用杀死Katrahaska获得的nanogates植入Trace来监控和交流，同时这也是让玩家可以继承死亡记忆无限重生方法，Trace死亡时nanogates会自动返回RebirthChamber,使用新的身体继续战斗

     Athetos发现了水仙女的新计划，获得了AD(Axiom Disruptor,初始武器和子弹程序,后面各种子弹只是Axiom Disruptor上可以装的程序)具有强大的战斗力,于是将因感染瘟疫变异的克隆体改造阻止Trace

     克隆体变异后失去大部分记忆并且会攻击任何人，但都被Trace击败了。

     后来遇上水仙女Veruska得知，她可以用梦制造世界，实际上地球也是她制造的一个梦，看到Athetos使用的英语感叹再一次见到这个语言，但是Athetos意外发现了世界修改地址的方法，将梦中的Athetos转移到了她们的现实世界Sudra。

     在Trace感染瘟疫后，Ophelia救起了Trace，并清除了Trace病原体，因为病原体就是Ophelia制造的，和Ophelia联系上后可以通过nanogates防止被再次感染。没有来得及找出解决病原体的方法,Athetos则得靠装置来阻止感染病原体。

     最后Trace还是来到了Athetos面前,知道如果告诉Trace真相Trace会被水仙女再次杀死，希望通过谎言让Trace发现破绽找出真相。

     摧毁Breach后，水仙女Elsenova消灭了Athetos，并让Trace陷入沉睡，Veruska让克隆人Trace通过梦世界重新回到了地球，但是水仙女没有使用地址修改的技术，Trace实体依然在Sudra。

     Trace回到地球开始研究在Sudra上事情，因为Athetos让他感觉另有真相，当他对这一切研究快产生结果时，Athetos出现告诉他无法逃脱他自己的善良本性，让他从这虚构的梦中醒来。（当然也有观点表示,让Trace再次重伤发现世界虚构的公理，再次通过地址修改来到Sudra，同时摆脱被nanogates监控的肉体）再次成为Athetos",Xia  hammondBang Zhu Xia De Yi Shi Xian Tong Guo  Di Zhi Xiu Gai  Ta Men Kai Shi Liao plan

++微妙的剧情、开放的结局。可惜英文水平不好的人理解有限。
+++有趣的 干涉/HACK 玩法

++武器多样丰富，但平衡性不足，有几个武器非常无用。

~过于异域风情的音乐，略微有点怪怪的。
~个别操作还需要进一步的优化，比如爪勾和2级衣服的短距离瞬移。个别剧情点需要比较极限的操作才能到达，感觉是不必要的门槛。
~即时存档！游戏里面说是存档点，其实是重生点，所有记录即时存档。可以随时退游戏返回重生点。

-----重生点是两格高！前期地图上每个存档点上面都缺一块，后期能上来了，上面TMD也没有东西…
-[strike]没有传送[/strike]每一块区域都比较复杂，很多东西远离列车通道。后期补充收集的时候跑图会比较累。
--BOSS战的设计比较简陋，攻击手法相当单调和机械，难以留下印象。

[*]プレイヤーの興味を惹く断片的に語られていくプロット
[*]豊富に用意されたアップグレードによる探索のモチベーション
[*]既存ジャンルの模倣のみに終わらない独自性の確立

[h1]メトロイドのイズムを継承しつつ独自性も追求した傑作[/h1]

　ニューメキシコの研究施設にて加速器実験の爆発事故に遭った科学者トレースが目を覚ますと、そこは見知らぬ異世界だった…。Another Worldなどにもあったありふれた導入から、自分の推測を裏付けるかのように断片的に明かされていく物語の語り口は、ビジュアルとサウンドに裏打ちされたSFベースの世界観と相まって薄気味悪さがジワジワと浸透して行き、実に惹き付けられるものがありました。

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=666622338

　本作をカテゴライズするならば、紛れも無くメトロイドヴァニア系、というよりはメトロイドクローンと言ってしまってよいと思います。クローンという単語は模倣を想起させネガティブな印象が纏わりつきますが、[strike]本家が迷走を続けている[/strike]現在ではユーザーが求めている体験を体現した望まれた継承者と言えます。本作は本家に酷似しつつも、ドローンやグリッチガンなど独自の遊びにも落とし込みがされており、これらはゲームプレイをより促進させる機能として作り上げられています。

　[u]物語、グラフィック、サウンドは一体感があり、異世界の雰囲気を演出することに大いに成功している[/u]という印象を持ちました。ここで言う一体感とは確立した世界観の提供であって、完全に調和の取れた統制を指すものではありません。互いが補完しあう関係にあり、計算された「いびつさ」が不気味な雰囲気に通じているのだと思います。

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=666622390

　操作は実に楽しいです。[u]滞空時の制動に強い慣性がなく落下の重力加速度が程よく調整されている[/u]物理法則は、最後まで繰り返し行うことになるジャンプをストレスのないものに感じさせます。歩きながらのジャンプしかできない冒頭では緩慢な移動速度に不安を覚えますが、スピードランを行う頃にはルート取りを暗記して無駄のない移動をしている自分自身がいると思います。移動のテクニックを習得して使いこなし、想定したルート取りを行えるとエンドルフィンがドバドバ出ます。

　トレースを強化するアップグレードやアイテムは所狭しと隠されており、これらを探すことが能動的な継続プレイを促しています。これらの強化アイテムと行く手を阻む敵の配置は絶妙で、接触による無敵時間中の強行通過も意図されたバランスになっています。[u]救済措置としてセーブと回復を司るポイントが要所に配置[/u]されており、リトライに配慮されているため[u]アクションが苦手でも安心[/u]です。所持しているアイテムによって移動できる範囲は限られていますが、必要最低限のアイテムしか取らない自由もあり、突き詰めると最低限の装備でも発想によって攻略難易度が左右されるデザインとなっているように感じられました。

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=666622361

　本作の最大の驚きは、Thomas Happ氏という[u]たった1人の開発者によって作り上げられている[/u]点に尽きます。5年の歳月をかけたその情熱とモチベーションには頭が下がる思いですし、プログラムもグラフィックもサウンドもプロットも全て1人でこなしつつ高い完成度を維持しているのは偉業といって差し支えありません。メトロイド好きなら何も考えずに「開発」することをオススメします。

Axiom Verge,japanese,"メトロイドの新作が出るのを長く待っているのに、リリースされるのはFPSだったり、ピンボールだったり、挙句の果てにサッカー（笑）だったりと絶望に打ちひしがれている私を救ってくれたのがこの作品。
アイテム入手ごとに広がる探索エリア、自由な攻略ルートに豊富な隠し通路とメトロイドの楽しさをしっかりと押さえていながら、敵やフィールドをハッキングして書き換ええていくオリジナルティ要素等もあり、ただのクローン作品で終わっていない。
タイムアタックモードも、クリア時間、アイテム100%収集時間、アイテム低取得数でクリアと3種類のモードがあるので、クリア後のやり込みにも熱が入る。
このアイテムを先に取得すれば、このアイテムは取らなくてもいいなとか攻略ルートを構築していくのが楽しい。初回プレイはクリアまで10時間以上かかってたのに今では40分台でクリアできるまでやり込んだ。方眼紙は偉大だ。

不満点を挙げるとすれば、アイテム取得時に独特のメロディーが無いｗ、使い道のない武器が多い、難易度ハードでも敵の攻撃パターンは同じというところ。
マップが広いわりにエリア移動手段が無いのが不満とレビューで挙げてる人が多いけど、私はタイムアタックをやりはじめると、ルート取りが重要になってくるので手軽にワープできないこの不便さがいいかなと思うようになったのであえて不満点としては挙げない。

[h1]Urban Empire：食之无味，弃之可惜。[/h1]

[h1]我们在梦想与进步中长大。[/h1]

1820年，皇帝赐了你一块地，给了你500k的个人起始资金和1000k的城市资金，作为城市的创建者，从下手划分第一块行政区起，你将要开始你的市长生涯。而这个城市的名字，你把它叫做“Kaisershafen”（要是你没改名的话）。

在最开始的阶段，只能建造一个低密度、仅有最基本的基础设施，甚至连分区比例都无法自定义的行政区，开始走向小城崛起的道路。

Kaisershafen的繁荣发展与别处是不同的，他麻雀虽小，但确人才济济——什么热力学、流行病学、炸药、电子游戏等等，都将在这里被发明。不要怀疑，是虽然表面上是发展云，但是研究完成一个之后会让你选择下一个“发明”，想来诺贝尔、开尔文这样的人物都蜗居在这个小城，这样一个小地方何愁不兴旺发达。甚至将来自己发射个卫星，也不是不可以。更难能可贵的是，这里还是人权斗士的运动基地，什么劳动法、女权、环保、动保，在这里都可以看到他们活动的身影，性爱革命、消除歧视这样的运动也是说“发明”就“发明”，端的是“世界何其大，发展靠我家”。虽然Kaisershafen在地球上占据了这么一个举足轻重的位置，但是也不固步自封，世界之大，我市伸出友谊之手，堪堪选出了6个未来入得了法眼的城市：牛津、旧金山、悉尼、圣彼得堡、上海、仙台，虽不是首都，[strike]但也横跨世界五大洲，哦不少了个非洲。[/strike]

但先不急，先把眼下这个小镇子经营好吧。


[h1]钱，钱，钱！[/h1]

城市发展之本，便是资金了，如何让运营城市的成本低于带来的收益，便是发展首要的问题。

每建立一个行政区，都需要额外的成本，而人口的增长和行政区数量的关系尚不明确，所以要慎重创建新的行政区，在有需求的时候再建岂不稳妥得多。发展的步子也不能迈的太大，不能将无法承担的基建一股脑儿的往城区上般，而要走一步看一步，先找个试验田看看带来的收益能不能值回成本，再考虑是否将这个推广。

这本是一个城市发展的应有方式，然而UE内部经济循环的不明确导致就算成本一时没有把握，城市入不敷出眼看走向崩溃，依然可以靠不断提高税率来弥补漏洞，而此时本是用来制衡市长行为的议会，居然也会用脚投票，只要不结余太多的提税提案，通通通过。

也尝试过降低税率来观察是否能通过刺激消费带来收入的提升，但结果是虽然有略微的提升，但是效果远不如直接调节税率来的明显。虽然高税率之下随处可见破产企业，但是城市收入还是稳步提升，人民也过得幸福如意，简直匪夷所思。

压榨人民制定高税率，虽然日子当下过得有些紧，但在研究完一项科技、时代更替下，收入能实现稳定的增长，日进斗金不是梦。正所谓“降税容易提税难”，赶早变着法从市民手中抠钱才是硬道理。


[h1]我最喜欢胁迫他人了[/h1]

既然提到了议会，那就不能不说说这个游戏的议会系统。

由于前几个时代皇帝钦定了玩家来做这个市长，完全不怕被弹劾，也不怕有竞争者的出现，本来用来制约玩家用来改变法案支持率的“政治货币”党派好感度，尤其在不能跌破下限-10的情况下，其本身意义也然无存。在好感度为正的情况下，恳求非常有效，一旦跌到负值，那么胁迫反而变成了最容易的途径。议会便犹如一个玩具，任由玩家揉捏。

就算是后期出现了竞选也无妨，只要城市发展良好，每两个月去稍微胁迫一下每个党派，市长位置还不是手到擒来。每6年一次的选举，也不过就是消耗我“政治货币”的途径而已，和之前已经不同

至于与经济相关联的提案，只要城市日进斗金，财务无忧，不管有什么政治诉求这些党派都会无脑通过。


[h1]我造的我来毁[/h1]

随着城市的发展，城市密度需要由低向高发展，来容纳更高效率的住房、工厂和商店。然而，在此之前已经建立的建筑物无法自动更新，于是中后期拆迁（需要科技解锁）就变成了一项很常见的工程。虽然看着一座座房屋轰然倒塌是一件很爽快的事情，但是一个区域那么多建筑，一个个点过来确实非常的累。在没有框选和快捷键的条件下，一个个选中建筑，移动到右下角摧毁，在到屏幕中间确认选择，然后一片区域重复几十次，是一件很傻B的事情。

虽然拆迁需要付出一定的代价，相应建筑物带来的利润也会随之失去，但是之后新建筑慢慢拔地而起，带来的利益也是明显的，只是太繁琐的操作容易让人失去耐心，所以我都是在区域比例分配那里先全选成住房，确定改变区域后，再全选为工厂，提交改变，用私人资金改后，再手动分配比例，反正改变区域比例不要钱，所以用自己的钱也就不需要提案，区域人员的安置赔偿都不用管，虽然也要动好几下鼠标，比一个个摧毁省力多了。[spoiler]
虽然这样就不能解锁拆迁成就了[/spoiler]


[h1]自由，平等，博爱！[/h1]

关于人权的问题，一直以来都是现实生活中争议颇多的地方，在这个游戏中也是。琳琅满目的提案，有些就算放到当前来看也是尚未实现。比如同工同酬、同性婚姻合法化等等。非常的pc，倒是我喜的部分。


[h1]退化完成[/h1]

最后说说这个游戏其他方面的质量。

游戏汉化不易，但是这个汉化的质量确实有点垃圾。比如前文提到的“发展”和“发明”指的是同一个东西；比如“少数名族”的同性恋问题；再比如将LGBT翻译为“同性恋”；再比如本段标题的“退化完成”，而英文原文是“Downsizing done”。而只在科技完成时出现的原本就不多z中文语音中，我竟然还在其中听到了一条英文语音，不过我倒是忘了记下是哪一段。没玩过游戏就翻译，以及缺少统筹校对，是很多已有汉化的通病，这个游戏汉化该有的也都有。


游戏本身其他的硬伤也不少：

1.流程单一，一个家族就是一个既定的事件，没有重复玩的价值。三张战役地图大同小异，也就是地形稍有区别，反而是三个挑战还有那么点意思。
2.优化烂，游戏进行到后期卡的不行，载入及保存时间长，常常未响应让人以为程序崩溃。玩着玩着程序崩了的情况也有发生过。
3.内部经济逻辑不清前面已经提及，进入下一个时代只不过就换了个接班人，收入却猛的增加，着实让人捉摸不透。
4.成就系统混乱不堪，目前成就各种张冠李戴。
5.画面，嗯感受一下高楼大厦吧（？

Styx: Shards of Darkness,japanese,"[h1]ステルスアクション。日本語対応。[/h1]
『Styx:Master of Shadows』の続編であり、『Of Orcs and Men』のスピンオフ作品。
ゴブリンが主人公で、透明化などの特殊な能力が使える。壁を登るなど三次元移動が多い点ではアサクリに似ているし。主に陰に隠れるステルススタイルはスプセルっぽくもあるし、クローゼットに隠れたり死体を隠したりするところはヒットマンに近い。
[b]【スト－リー】[/b] 
2作目であるため、前作をプレイしていないと世界観が分からずとっつきにくいと思うが、ストーリー自体に前作との繋がりはほとんど無い。
死んだらプレイヤーを罵倒するムービーが流れたり（設定でOFF可能）、ちょいちょい製作者や他のステルスゲー（アサクリ等）に言及するなどメタ発言が目立つ。
[b]【戦闘】[/b] 
後ろから敵に忍び寄りキルできる。普通のキルは音が出るので周りに気付かれる可能性がある。逆にステルスキルは音が出ないがキルするのに時間が掛かる。
直接キルする以外にも、食べ物や水に毒（Styxのゲロ）を入れたり、吹き矢や罠を使ったり、シャンデリアを落としたりといった方法で暗殺可能。
敵に気付かれても戦闘はできるがこちらから攻撃はできず、敵の攻撃をはじき、よろけたところでキルする。この敵の攻撃をはじくタイミングがシビアで結構難しい上、同時に1人しか対応できないため、複数の敵に襲われた場合は死確定。
[b]【ステルス】[/b] 
暗闇に隠れての隠密が基本だが、壺の中に入ったり机の下に身を隠したりもできる．敵の死体は運ぶことができ、クローゼットなどに死体を隠すこともできる。
暗闇の中ではゴブリンのナイフが光るので、自分が暗闇に隠れられているのかどうか一目でわかる。
[b]【特殊能力】[/b] 
クローン（殺傷能力のない分身）生成、透明化、千里眼（アイテムや敵のハイライト）の3つ．クローンと透明化はMPを消費する。各能力はスキルで強化可能。
[b]【システム】[/b] 
各ミッションの『サブミッション達成』『クリア時間』『被警戒数』『不殺』『収集品数』をそれぞれ金銀銅で評価される。評価が高いとより多くのXPを取得でき、そのXPでスキルを開放していく。前作同様スキルでStyxが劇的に強くなることはない。
[b]【総評】★★★★★★★★☆☆　良作[/b] 
前作から操作性等が向上し遊びやすくなっている。クイックセーブが可能で、ストレスフリーな作り。システムに大きな変更点はないため、前作を楽しめた人は間違いなく楽しめるだろう。
以下不満点
・前作同様プレイスタイルに幅がない
・クローンの使いどころが無い
・後半のマップが前半の使いまわし",styxmaster shadowsnoSok Bian deari orcs mennosupinohuZuo Pin  bsutorib bZhan Dou b bsuterusub bTe Shu Neng Li b bshisutemub bZong Ping  Liang Zuo b Yi Xia Bu Man Dian  Qian Zuo Tong Yang pureisutairuniFu ganai kuronnoShi idokorogaWu i Hou Ban nomatsupugaQian Ban noShi imawashi

ストーリーは前作から相当先の話らしいが、別に前作をやらなくても大丈夫。
ただ前作をプレイした方がいろいろとわかりやすい。
グラフィックが大幅に進化している。
基本的なシステムは前作と一緒、不意打ちからのキルがメインで前方からのごり押しで敵を倒すことはできない。
新しい追加アクションとしてロープの滑り降りやクローンに新スキルが増えている。
新スキルのテレポートがあるので簡単になってるように感じた。
もう1つの追加要素で協力プレイがある。
こちらは片方が死んでも、もう片方が生きている場合は10秒後に復活することができる。2人同時に死ぬとゲームオーバー。
しかしHPが少なくて、少しでもダメージを受けると即死、パリィができない、セーブがオートセーブのみとやってみた感じだと協力プレイの方が明らかに難しく感じた。
PS4のコントローラーでプレイする場合、ビックピクチャーモードのPS4コントローラーを使用にチェックが入ってると、逆におかしくなってクローン操作ができなくなるので使う場合は外さないといけない。

Umbrella Corps,schinese,"为什么在这么多差评之中，我要给好评。很简单。因为这款游戏让我认清了自己就他丫是个逗逼。游戏出之前我本来是很看好这个游戏的，而且从试玩视频视频看来射击手感和动作元素也很丰富，最主要的是价格也在能接受的范围之中，于是我便兴高采烈的预购了这个游戏。然而，我万万没想到，这个游戏成为了今年烂作中的极品，是条独一无二的黑马。他告诉了人们，世界上没有最烂的游戏，只有更烂的游戏。
1.服务器渣成狗，20·30分钟匹配到一组。后来直接鬼服，完全没有人玩了。
2.武器稀少，主武器副武器加起来也就40把（我不知道后面还有没有更新），最主要的是主副武器加起来还不如一把斧子好用，最终这个游戏所有模式都变成了纯粹的白刃战。
3.毫无单人剧情。确切的说是单人模式毫无剧情，没有过场，只有一段文字开头，重复的刷多人模式有过的地图，然后杀一些多人模式吊都不吊的僵尸，然后一直杀僵尸到任务结束。简单来说，这个游戏单人模式就是一段又臭又长的游戏教程。
4.武器以及服装，以及涂装都需要等级解锁，为什么说这一点，因为这个游戏都没人玩了，你他喵叫我怎么升级。顺便说一下你打多少单人模式，多人模式的角色都不会升级。
5.人物动作过于幽默，作为安布雷拉特工，爬的速度比走的都快.....
6.武器操作手感垃圾，除了近战。一丁点打击感都没有，枪声让人听的也很憋屈。
7.画面渣，优化更渣。场景重复性太高，地图和模式也让人嗨不起来。

所以这个游戏的诞生，完全是要让别的游戏对它引以为鉴，告诉那些游戏开发商什么叫做烂游戏。",

Iconoclasts,schinese,"一句话总结，游戏性极其优秀，故事极其混乱糟糕。
游戏性已经有太多人赞美过，我不多说。这方面的缺憾是，这个游戏的收集品作用实在过弱，基本是为收集而收集，有没有拿到影响很小。而且剧情本身是线性的，如果不是为了搜集，完全没必要往回跑。
另外，我怀疑原先的设计应该是队内各人物可以随时切换，通过这种方式合作解谜。但实际游戏中几乎不用合作，绝大部分时间玩家只能操作女主。我怀疑是各种原因导致合作解谜被砍了，换而言之，这个游戏只是个半成品。
剧情方面让人诟病的就非常多了。游戏中提供了选项，但选什么完全没影响。游戏中出现各种势力各种人物，制作者野心很大，但完全驾驭不了。人物做事的动机不明，势力的立场同样令人困惑，感觉像一群疯子在胡闹，都不知道为何而疯。最后结局更是令人无语，女主角外的所有人几乎都做了无用功，特别是惨被抛弃的男主，女主角随随便便就打败了最终boss，让所有人在末世下的忧虑和疯狂显得可笑。
我再次怀疑这个游戏只是半成品，无论是合作解谜，收集品的作用，还是混乱不清的剧情，总让人觉得不应该是这样，本应做得更好。所以，虽然我很喜欢这个游戏，但无法推荐别人游玩。",Yi Ju Hua Zong Jie You Xi Xing Ji Qi You Xiu Gu Shi Ji Qi Hun Luan Zao Gao

Iconoclasts,schinese,"感谢Joakim Sandberg，在制作诺尼爱2的十年后又独立制作出这款游戏，游戏的风格也从纯横板动作闯关变成了类银河战士恶魔城佳作。想起6，7年前自己玩着盗版诺尼爱2囫囵吞枣通关，到前一段时间突发奇想在steam搜索诺尼爱2，结果惊喜地发现居然12年就已经上线steam了，购入之后又通关了几遍（诺尼爱2 Noitu Love 2 通关后可以使用其他人物通关，每个人物操作不同，关卡也有一定区别）。[strike]  时代的眼泪啊眼泪啊，已经老了。 [/strike]

      新作作为类银河战士恶魔城游戏，最重要的特点就是那个极具特色的格状地图以及收集要素了。本作与最近出的血污相比，其实地图并不大，传送点到最后也只有8个，收集要素也并不是很多（只有开箱子以及用于开隐藏boss的字条），但是作为一个纯单人制作的独立游戏，真的已经十分不易了。

      其次，通关之后的可玩性其实并不如诺尼爱2好，顶多通关之后解锁boss rush以及致命难度，并无让人重复通关的欲望。唯一让人有重复欲望的，就是要素收集100%的与否以及模块制造100%的与否会影响到最后结尾时不同人物的立绘。这里要吐槽一点，就是成就里有一项是要求在致命难度通关本作，然鹅致命难度是一击必死，所以打扰了打扰了=，= 当然本作在每次读取游戏存档的时候可以重新选择难度，所以理论上说可以在打最终boss前存档，然后读档改成致命难度，接着再打boss，但是这样的话，一来也需要你能无伤打死最终boss，二来对于我来说，直到最后通关才想起这个事，然而我已经把通关存档覆盖到了最终boss之前的档，所以生无可恋啊，有兴趣的同学可以尝试一下。

      地图设计与解谜方面，本作不愧是作者打磨7年的作品，随着游戏新武器以及扳手新功能的解锁，之前地图上的新区域也可以进行探索，因此虽然地图小，但并没有枯燥的感觉；另一方面，解谜部分也是恰当好处，特别是高塔部分，真的可以看出作者的功力。

      战斗方面，大部分boss的击杀方式并不相同，很多都需要攻击特定的部位或者需要不同的攻略机制，还是蛮有乐趣的。但是与诺尼爱2相比，其实不如后者特点鲜明。[strike] 强推诺尼爱2！[/strike]

      音乐方面，由于个人偏爱8比特音乐，所以本作音乐我给满分。（诺尼爱2的音乐也是满分，在这里强烈推荐大家听一下诺尼爱2中boss之一joy以及轮盘4个boss的战斗音乐，蜜汁带感）

      最后，最需要提及的则是故事方面，故事开始给人一种开朗明亮的氛围，随着故事的进行，剧情的转折与冲突、每个人的立场以及游戏背景也慢慢向我们揭露，游戏的氛围也开始慢慢变得凝重，[spoiler] 为什么非要通过献祭罗伊尔才能逃生回地球呢（在油管上看到有人说“U CAN SAVE ROYAL BUT IS NOT GOOD...HOW? U NEED THE SKILL TO DO 2 JUMPS IN A ROW...U SAVE HIM AND U CAN GET 1 SCREEN NEAR THE ROCKET...BUT THE GAME WILL CRASH AND A SCREEN WILL SAY ""I DON'T PROGRAM THIS..REGARDS"" ”，不得不说，作者想的还挺详细的XD）[/spoiler] 到了故事的结尾，游戏的最终boss出场的时候，我一开始还以为这个boss是作者恶搞的，后来仔细一想，却又在情理之中，这何尝不是一种超现实的表现呢？再加上打完之后主角的结局，我想，作者在制作这款游戏的7年里，自己也随着时间而成熟，从而有了这样的结局吧。

      总的来说，这款游戏制作了7年，游戏最终呈现的品质也完全值得作者打磨7年，除去由于游戏类型的限制（偏解谜）而造成的略显拖沓感之外，其他各个方面均可以说是独立游戏中的翘楚，甚至在个别方面比市面上的某些3A游戏更显得用心。在此，强烈推荐。[spoiler] 当然，更强烈推荐Noitu Love 2，大家赶紧去买来玩呀！[/spoiler]

[spoiler] 到现在还记得，自己当初随便通关诺尼爱2之后看着boss演出列表里缺失的隐藏boss而并未再探究，而后与室友开黑LOL，如今只能感叹一声“初识不知曲中意,再闻已是曲中人。” [/spoiler]

[spoiler] 每个人都可以问一下自己，我的内心是罗宾呢？还是罗伊尔？还是米娜？还是埃尔罗呢？抑或是游戏中的其他人物呢？[/spoiler]",Gan Xie joakimnoitu Shi Dai De Yan Lei A Yan Lei A Yi Jing Lao Liao  can save royal but is not goodhow u need skill to dojumps in a rowu save him u can getscreen near rocketbut will crash a screen will say i dont programregards love spoiler spoiler spoiler

欲扬先抑，先说一下游戏的缺点。
[list]
[*]<Iconoclasts>《叛逆机械师》去年11月的时候更新了中文，此举正好赶在了圣诞促销开始之前，游戏正式发售10个月之后。翻开商店评价，第一条获得了很多“有用”记号的好评，提到[quote=Lon von Manteuffel的评测]翻译质量也相当不错[/quote]还提到游戏中存在的一些“问题”，我个人觉得这位玩家可能没有真正去玩，而从其游戏时长3.1小时和只打了个开头的成就列表也能看得出来确实如此。但他的评测却声称是“真实评测”，我觉得这是非常不负责任的。很遗憾，我在近乎完美通关这款游戏之后的各种想法正好和他相反，虽然游戏内已经实现中文本地化，但是有至少20%的翻译是机翻，或者说非常得不专业。再加上游戏的剧情并没有直白地写在纸上，而是通过对话、隐喻不断暗示玩家，这就导致许多中文玩家需要依靠大量的联想才能弄明白剧情到底讲了什么。另外这还使得部分玩家甚至看不懂当前任务要做什么，如果有段时间没玩再捡起来看看真的摸不着头脑。[spoiler][b]下面这段话跟Iconoclasts无关，[/b]随着中国玩家涌入steam市场，外国游戏制作商特别是独立游戏制作者愿意提供中文翻译是一件好事，但随之而来的是大量质量低下的中文机翻，部分没什么人气的游戏通过这种投机取巧的方式就能打开中国市场，让人觉得很不是滋味。[/spoiler]
[*]另外一个问题是，
[url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/25/iconoclasts-second-opinion/]The more I play, the less I like Iconoclasts[/url]
这是一篇对Iconoclasts的评论，我比较赞同作者其中说的一点，游戏（主要指boss战部分）的指引很不充分，这导致我们在攻略的途中需要通过不断试错（往往意味着死亡）来弄明白当前关卡的设计，这让人非常得frustrated。我还记得其中一个boss战关卡需要不断操控两个人做不同的事互相配合，但在途中就早早地陷入了不知所措的境遇，似乎按什么键都没用，这是很让人不舒服的。游戏引导是非常重要的一环，Iconoclasts在这方面做得还不够好。
[/list]


说了这么多坏话，该说说这款游戏为什么值得我推荐[strike]我要开始吹了[/strike]
[list]
[*]首先，流程线性对于解谜游戏或者一款类银河战士恶魔城游戏来说其实并不是缺点，我看[strike]没错，又是他[/strike]那篇好评里居然说解谜太过线性是游戏的错，实际上线性的是主线的剧情以及随剧情解锁的谜题而已，这是很好的游戏设计方式，它使得玩家目标明确，知道该做什么才能推动剧情发展。
[*]游戏的boss战令人印象尤为深刻，这款游戏有大大小小二十多个boss[spoiler]以及两个隐藏boss[/spoiler]，以及数十种不同的小怪，每一场boss战都有不同的机制和弱点，需要合理利用手中的工具、武器以及各类场景道具来完成目标。大多数boss随着血量的下降都有多个阶段，有的甚至会完全转换成另一种游戏模式，真的、真的很棒。
[*]谜题的难度适中，大多数情况下对操作的要求并不高，并且配合了多个地图有着多个不同的解谜主题。说实话要做到难度适中而又有多样性的解谜是不容易的，但这款游戏在这方面也做得很不错，让人非常喜欢。
[*]玩起来的手感非常流畅，我用键盘玩，没有感到任何不适，[strike]这里又要点名批评Rabi-Ribi了，真实稀烂的手感手柄都救不回来[/strike]程序员牛逼！（场景也很好看，好像也是程序员画的？）音乐还可以，比较切合场景，但确实没能让我特别有感触。
剧情和人物的构建都非常真实饱满（可惜配了个不通顺的中翻），完整的流程大约在12~15小时左右，支线以及全隐藏要素收集大概需要额外的4~6小时才能完成。

　私がIconoclastsを知ったのは昨年の5th of BitSummitに展示されていたのを見たときが初めてでした。緻密なドット絵がぬるぬる動く様子を見て、発売されたら絶対買おうとその場で決意。普段はどれだけ周回遅れになろうと気にせずあまり定価買いはしないのですが、本作は先述の経緯もあって発売日に定価で購入しました。結論から言えば、その判断は間違っていなかったと思います。満足。

　本作の見た目は実に華やかです。SFC全盛期を思わせるような画面のつくりは、UIを含めて見ているだけでとてもワクワクします。7年かけて単独開発したと巷で言われているのもあって、ただただ驚くばかりです。静止画でも十分美しいですが、動かした際のキャラクターアニメーションの演技は本当に優れていると思います。待機モーションなどは勿論のこと、イベントで肩を寄せて抱き合うシーンなどの拍子、リズムがとても丁寧に描写されていて見ててなんか凄くいいなと感じました。

　特筆すべきは操作感がとても優れていることです。アクションゲームで思い通りに動かせることはとても大切なことだと個人的には捉えています。変な移動慣性もなく、入力と反応の誤差が無いのでとても素直なプレイ感覚を得られました。プレイ中に入力を妨げるような処理落ちなども一切感じられず、最適化の面でも度重なる調整をされたことが窺えます。そうしたフィーリングを後押しするようにピコピコと弾むような足音のSEはとても可愛らしく歩くだけでも楽しさを伝えてくれます。

　ボス戦も実に魅力的です。ボスのライフが減少している程度によって攻撃パターンが変化するので、新しいボスに出会うたびパターン構築のしがいがありました。接近して使用するレンチは攻撃のリーチこそ短いものの試してみると色んな攻撃を弾き返せるので、銃(スタンガン)もいいんだけどとりあえず殴ってみる(物理)という野蛮な思考こそ至高です。やっぱりメカニック女子はこうでなくちゃね。他の色んなアクションゲームで棒立ちだったり、モブと化す味方NPCが、本作では結構ボスの弾を迎撃したり、ダウンまで奪ってくれたりと奮闘してくれるところもボス戦の見どころだったりします。

　明るいビジュアルに反して描かれる物語はちょっと重たいです。本作の世界にはアイボリーと呼ばれるエネルギー源があり、これを用いて生活を支える機械を稼働させています。普段このエネルギー源は電池という形で区画ごとに配給されており、登録なしに無断でアイボリーに触れることは禁じられています。このエネルギー源はワン・コンサーンと呼ばれる武装した宗教組織が牛耳っており、実質上世界を支配しています。組織の教義から著しく逸脱した家庭には「聖罰」がくだり、一家ごと誅殺されるというトンデモ世界なのです。主人公であるロビン(マザーグースの一篇でも知られるよう、愛称はコマドリ)はワン・コンサーンのメカニックであった亡き父親のレンチを隠し持っており、そこからゴタゴタに巻き込まれていくことになります。

　シナリオは人によっては少々とっつきにくいかもしれません。聖罰の下らない選ばれた民だけが住むことのできる街なんて、いかにもな宗教による選民思想で個人的には大満足なんですが、陣営の思惑やイデオロギー、思想などが頻出するため、堅苦しく感じたり、陳腐に感じる方がいらっしゃるかもしれません。またアクションゲームとして見ると、操作性の良さはありますがシナリオ偏重で後半になるまで一本道の展開となっているため、投げてしまうとせっかくの優れた演出の数々を見失う可能性はあります。勿論過度に重くならないようキャラクターはとても魅力的な掛け合いを行いますし、初見では感情移入しづらい敵陣営の背景などが後々描かれることで、リプレイした際にこのときはこういう意図で話していたのね、と改めて発見することがあります。私は好き！

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1278893461

　マップごとの各エリアは画面端まで移動すると遷移するメトロイドヴァニア方式ですが、初期の探索範囲は広くなく、またシナリオ進行に伴って一時的に後戻りできないシーケンスが続くため、序盤では開けられない宝箱などが見えると、それが今開けられるものなのかどうかの判断がつきにくいです。後半で自由にエリア間移動ができるようになった際に収集要素はコンプリートできるようになっているため、これからプレイされる方は時限的な要素はないので安心してください。またパズル要素は新しいマップに訪れる度に新しいギミックが登場し、結構頭を悩ませます。それなりには悩むものの、どうしようもなくなって詰まることはなかったのでいい按配だったと思います。

　ユーザビリティ的な観点から言及すると、イベントなどでのデモスキップはちゃんと搭載されており、画面上下に黒帯が出るような演出は大体スキップできるようになっています。リトライはゲームオーバー後に即リトライとセーブから再開を選択でき、画面右下に兵士のアイコンが出るところからリトライで再開できます。ボス戦など繰り返し行う可能性がある箇所で即リトライができるようになっているのはとてもありがたかったです。リトライすることでの実績的なペナルティなどはありませんので積極的な活用を推奨します。

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1278893439

　唯一残念だったのはカスタムの装備反映が分かりづらかった点です。カスタムとはパッシブのスキルスロットのようなもので、そのエリア特徴を捉えたカスタマイズを施せばそれなりに有利に戦えるようになります。ただカスタムはダメージを受けることによって3つのスロットのうち右側から無効化されていきます。1回ダメージを受けても無かったことにするカスタムがあるのですが、こちらを仮に一番左に1つだけつけていても前2つのカスタムが無効化されない限り効果を得られない仕様が分かりづらかったです。一周クリアしたあとに解禁される一発ダメージを受けたら即死するゲームモードで、この事実に気付かずラスボスまで進めてからこの事実を知って愕然としました。そこに至るまでのオートセーブが発生しない三連続ボス戦の3時間はなんだったのか…。


　ドットベースのゲームであるためVer.1.13時点で162MBとコンパクトなサイズであり、常にHDD容量を気にしながらインストールとアンインストールを繰り返している私もこのゲームはインストールしたままになりそうです。ゲーム中の表現で身体の部位欠損が描写されるところがあり、そこがお子様対象だとどうかなと思うところもありますが、ドットグラフィックなので幾分マイルドに抑えられていると思います。プレイしてこんなに気持ちのいいゲームは久しぶりだったので、もっとたくさんの人にこのゲームを知ってもらえるといいなぁと思います。操作感の優れたアクションゲームをお求めの方には特にオススメ！",Hua rakanaCao Zuo Xing  Mei shiidotsutogurahuitsukusutoanimeshiyon Er Zhang rinonaiXin Di yoisaundo Mei Li De deGe Xing De nakiyarakutaDa  Gong Ji patannoLi Fu nabosuZhan  Cheng yokuNao mashiipazurulist

Staxel,japanese,"忙しいと一日が過ぎるのがあっという間、というのをガチで体験できる、マイクラ系サンドボックス＋牧場物語(＆どうぶつの森？)なスローライフゲー。

舞台は十数人しか村人のいない島。
その村はずれにある、ボロボロに荒れ果てた農場を引き継ぐことになったプレイヤー。

というわけで基本は農作物や動物を育てて、収穫物を売りさばいてお金を稼ぐのが基本なのですが、個性的な村人たちから「建物を建てて」だの「料理を作って」だの「隠された○○を探して」だの、「お前ら俺を農家だと思ってないだろ？」と言いたくなるような様々な依頼(クエスト)を要求されます。

そんなわけで農家の本業もこなしつつ、空いた時間に村の便利屋として様々な依頼をこなして丸一日奔走しているうちに、いつの間にか夜は明けて、眠気に耐え切れなくなり慌ててベッドに飛び込む(たまに間に合わず道端で寝落ちる)、という超忙しい毎日が待っています。

しかしこれが超楽しい！　やばい！　気が付くと延々と遊んでしまう中毒性があります。
あまりのハマりっぷりにずっと遊んでて、ふと気が付くと「あれ、今何時だっけ？」と現実を忘れてしまったのは久しぶり。

最近ゲームを遊んでても1時間もしたら疲れてきて「もうおっさんだから昔みたいにゲームにハマる体力と精神力がないのかなぁ……」なんて思ってたのに、このゲームはぶっつづけで14時間近くも遊んでしまいました。
「時間泥棒」「時間が溶ける」という表現を身をもって体験することになるとは……。

ストーリー性は薄いですが、登場する村人たちが個性的＆可愛いのと、農業の他に建築、アイテムクラフト、料理などやれることが多くて飽きません。
ただ農場がある程度広がって来ると、シングルプレイでは自分一人しか農業できないので(当たり前)、植えた作物を収穫するだけで一日が終わってしまい時間が足らなくなってくるのと、その頃にはお金も溜まりまくってて農業をやる意味が薄れてくるので、農場ゲーとしてはその辺りが飽き時なのかもしれませんね。","Wu Tai haShi Shu Ren shikaCun Ren noinaiDao  shikashikoregaChao Le shii yabai Qi gaFu kutoYan ""toYou ndeshimauZhong Du Xing gaarimasu"

Staxel,japanese,"牧場経営と建築を楽しめるサンドボックス。
マルチプレイでフレンドとも遊べる。楽しい。

アーリーアクセス中でまだボリュームは少ないが前述の牧場経営要素や建築に加え、村人との交流を楽しむことができる。気になるあの子と仲良くなったりできるし、新たな住民が増えることもある。

[h1]メインは農業による経営[/h1]
開発者はこのゲームの重点を農業に置いている。なのでまずここに着目したい。基本的にアイテムはお金で買うシステムになっている。よってゲームのサイクルは

「農業をする」→「お金を貯める」→「新しい道具や畜産物等を買う」

の繰り返しとなる。
序盤の金策は虫取りがおすすめだ。虫取り網の出費だけで済む。
安定した収入源がほしいなら蜂蜜、慣れてきたら料理に手を出すと良いだろう。
加工品は基本的に高く売れるが、ブロック類は加工すると値下がりすることが多いので金策には向かない。

[h1]余ったお金で建築[/h1]
建築は基本的にその余剰金でしていくことになる。

従来のサンドボックスゲームに親しんでいるプレイヤーはブロックや道具類がクラフトによって得られないのを不満に感じるかもしれないがそれで良いのである。なぜならこのゲームはマインクラフトのように探索や収集によるアイテム集めが中心のゲームでは無くて、あくまで牧場経営がメインコンテンツだからだ。

とは言ってもすべてがはじめから店売りされているわけではなく、ごく基本的なブロック類はクラフトによって得ることができるようになっている。希少なアイテムも同様だ。これは1～4のアイテムを組み合わせることで行えるようになっている。序盤は野暮ったく感じるかもしれないが、クラフト台を複数置けることやクラフト枠にアイテムをスタックしたままにできる点をうまく活用しよう。面倒なレシピも1度セットしておけば材料の継ぎ足しだけでずっと作れるし、マルチプレイでは量産時にみんなで同じものを作れるので意外と便利だ。

さらにお金があまっているなら宅配でほとんどなんでも買えるようになるので面倒な材料収集に時間を掛けること無く、思う存分建築に専念できる。

なおブロックにはサイズが可変のものがある。
これによって中間ブロック無しで細かな表現ができるようになっているが、仕組みを理解していないと混乱する人もいるかも知れないので参考画像を貼っておく。

Staxel,japanese,"minecraftとstardewValleyを融合させたけど案の定良いとこどりとはならなかった3Dサンドボックス牧場スローライフゲーム
つまらなくはないがお勧めは出来ない。気になるようなら安く手に入る時にどうぞという感じ
ゲームの方向性は中々気に入っているが、そもそもシステムの根本が糞なので今後どれだけ精力的にアップデートしようが良ゲーになることはないであろう

[u]悪い点[/u]
１、金、金、金！サンドボックスとして恥ずかしくないのか！
このゲームの特にウンザリさせられる所の１つが、大抵のアイテムの入手手段が購入のみであることだ。そもそもMAPが中心に小さな[strike]村[/strike]町があるだけの狭い島なのでアイテムを探しに遠出をするという探索要素がない。更にクラフト可能なアイテムも少ない。結果プレイヤーは只管金策を繰り返して金を貯めなければ碌な建築が出来ない
更にこれを悪化させているのが配送カタログというアイテムの存在だ。このアイテムはゲーム内に実装されているほぼ全てのアイテムが購入可能なAmazonもかくやという超便利アイテムであり、このアイテムの存在が今後もこのゲームは効率の良い金策をひたすら行ってアイテムを購入するだけのゲームになることを予感させてくれる

２、クラフトゲームとして未熟
上記したが、まずクラフト可能なアイテムが少ない。更にクラフトには加工工程に合わせていくつもの作業台が必要であり、更にアイテムは1つずつしか作ることが出来ずアイテム１つを作るのに数秒の作業時間が必要なのでアイテムを複数クラフトしようとするとクリック→数秒待つ→クリックと只管繰り返さねばならない
この仕様があまりにも面倒だったため自分の場合クラフトするのは「卵を煮てゆで卵にする」「サトウキビを煮て白砂糖にし、更にそれと苺を煮て苺ジャムにする」「牛乳を混ぜてクリームにし、更にそれを混ぜてバターにする」の比較的手間がかからず金策できる３つを嫌々やっているだけで、他のクラフトアイテムはすべて購入で済ませている

３、サンドボックスゲームとして未熟
これはちょっと文章で説明するのが難しいのだが、ブロックを設置した際の大きさがおかしい。
例えば同じブロック５つを十字に並べたとする。そして中心のブロックを1つ破壊すれば中心にブロック1つ分の大きさの穴が出来る・・・と普通なら思うだろうが、このゲームでは中心に出来る穴はブロック半分程度の小さなものになる。
他には0.9の高さのブロックを縦に２つ並べた際の高さが1.8ではなく1.9だったり、ただの色違いのはずのブロックを隣接させると特定のブロックがもう片方のブロックを侵食したり。
なんでこんなことになっているのかだが、このゲームは世界を1x1x1のマスで構成しているのにそれに満たないサイズのブロックばかりであるためブロック同士を隣接させた際に出来るはずの隙間を埋めるように見た目が大きくなるようになってる為だと思われる

[u]逆に良いところ[/u]
NPCからの依頼で建築するというのはなかなか面白かった。大抵のサンドボックスゲームは建築がメインであるのにもかかわらずゲーム進行に必要な建築は最低限でよかったりするわけだが、このゲームではプレイヤーにとって不必要な建物を依頼で作らせそれをNPCが利用するためゲーム進行におうじて町が発展していく。ただ建築するたび建材の購入費用で大金が溶けるうえ見返りがあまりないので奴隷状態感が否めない

整个游戏人物设计性格鲜明，伦太郎在看似中二病玩世不恭的“疯狂科学家”的表象下，实际上是个关心自己实验室每位成员的热心肠；红莉栖的傲娇外表下，又通过她对实验的热枕彰显了她“天才少女”的智商和严谨的性格。然而当之前暗流涌动的伏笔逐渐汇聚起来，层层抽丝剥茧之后，剩下的只有展现给伦太郎的残酷现实，以及穿越过去，现在与未来的名为“时间”的河流的，从命运石之门而来的终极选择。。。
虽然对整个故事时间线/相对论部分引用的严谨性以及各处的伏笔还是有几处疑问，不过丝毫不影响整个故事配合上音乐和配音带动我的心情波澜起伏。
顺便提一嘴，很难想象这游戏是在2009年做出来的，可以说现在的牵扯到转生和量子物理理论相关的作品都能或多或少看到这部作品的影子。然后翻一翻这个游戏的tips表，你会惊讶的发现很多东西都是2009年就已经有了的。

。。。刚刚完成TE，说实话震撼的不行，整个感情被故事吊着走。不过也有一个非常明显的漏洞：假如因果关系在观测理论成立，且不能被改变的前提下，既然其他世界线的的故事并不算在因果关系内，为啥伦太郎没有想到通过Dmail去影响更久远的过去？为何没有考虑过gamma世界线成立的可能性啊喂www
然后，看到最后伦太郎和克里斯蒂娜相遇的场景，立马想到君名是不是借鉴了石头门，稍微查了一下，发现KID社还做过更久远的穿越题材的r11。。。

STEINS;GATE,schinese,"命运石之门作为一款已经有10年历史的ADV游戏，早已声名在外，评价很高，是科学ADV系列作品中认可度最高的一部。

这一部作品的世界观设定相对完整，逻辑上可以自恰，剧情设置了多处伏笔，缺点主要是前几章在日常篇的节奏相对偏慢，故事进行到一半处开始展开，节奏突然加快。从各个角色的个人线到真结局可谓一气呵成，通关之后感觉非常的舒服。

作为一部视觉小说类游戏，游戏里主要的交互手段是“手机触发器”(phone trigger)，通过收发短信/接听电话，来决定剧情的走向，影响到游戏的分支选项的不是很多，更多是彩蛋的形式，许多成就都是通过手机触发器来完成的。

在游戏中有很多内容映射了一些现实事物，比如用@ch来映射2ch。这里不得不吐槽一下steam版的中文翻译，为了把一些2ch梗本地化，中文翻译中加入了很多“本地梗”的翻译，但这些梗在经过了一段时间之后，不免显得过时，让现在的人来玩，显得比较尴尬。读起来非常的生硬。

STEINS;GATE,schinese,"牛逼，神作，有什么好说的？

以坚实的科学假想理论和acg术语堆砌出的的恋爱游戏.

当初动漫播出的时候被命运石之门深深吸引，电脑上下了破解版的却因为剧情重复的无聊感没有坚持下去，steam上出现移植版也是第一时间入手，因为同样的原因就一直搁置，就在最近我终于通关原版与精英版。
这一切都是命运石之门的选择。

原作很好玩，前期确实慢热，以通关后的眼光来看，其实信息量很大，简单易懂的介绍了大量科学理论基础作为故事背景同时为后续剧情埋下无数伏笔，前期的默默贡献是后续剧情能直接超神的主要原因。
前期觉得无聊的话就多看Tips和短信内容吧，还挺有意思的XD

剧情和人物就简单说一下了，男主冈部伦太郎自称疯狂科学家的中二病，虽然是个中二病生活中却又很多愿意几首他的志同道合的朋友，在一次意外的中发现自己制造出了时间机器的雏形，后来在女主牧濑红莉栖的帮助下完成了时间跳跃机，一切正如疯狂科学家设想的那样，世界即将因为自己的发明陷入混沌之中，但他却没有主要到自己的周围其实正暗流涌动即将陷入大危机。于是和周围亲近的人相识相爱又相别的科幻爱情故事开始了。

应该说，这一部是命运石之门主线作品里最好的一部，相比动漫有更多隐藏剧情，相比精英版有更多Tips和互动要素，相比0（我0还没有玩，只看了动漫，粗略说下）0的剧情模式和这一部比较相似，审美有些疲劳。
精英版虽然叫精英版，我倒是觉得应该叫新手版。

如果只是听说是神作，想来尝试命运石之门的话，建议看动漫或者玩精英版吧，他们会更好被接受，如果各种原因坚持想玩这一部，一定要坚持下去，绝对不会辜负你的期待，拜托了，虽然我拖了这么久才玩但我还是想这么拜托。

顺带一提，通关后我坚持学了下believe me 的钢琴曲，尽管我并不会弹钢琴，至少这一首我学会了。

好了，以往万一只能说到这了，“机关”的爪牙有没有追踪到steam社区就糟了，多说无益。

STEINS;GATE,schinese,"【
这一周晚上基本都在玩这个游戏，先说说积攒一周的怨念吧：
我玩ADV/AVG这类阅读速度很快的，但前三天快被这傻兮兮的日常剧情逼疯了。 现在回想，这基本一半的剧本都花在这些日常上面了，真佩服编剧，正反话都有。
主角还是个中二病，配合猫女两个中二病，各种中二对话...看得想砸手柄了。
如果没有网络上大量的好评以及steam商店的好评如潮，我想我在第三小时就放弃游戏打入冷藏室再也不会打开了吧，也很好奇当年改编动画播出时整整一个季度的日常前半段是怎么度过的。顺便说一句，命运石之门的精英版，有点过分，更换动画资源去多花这么多钱的话，不是很推荐，原版就ok了。
这个游戏没有流程图，在打多结局的时候会非常痛苦，记得多存档。
而且快速存档功能不知道为何还失灵了，导致我一开始就丢了两次存档，很佩服我坚持下来了。可能这也是命运石之门的安排吧。

怨念之后还是给个好评。好评全是给剧本的。
也是希望好评能让慕名而来的玩家在被前面日常逼疯的时候保持理性。就像凶真一样在世界,时间，命运面前坚持探索一线生机，即使快疯了也不要放弃。
另外:
主角好像跟出现的所有女角色都有一腿？即使如此，真结局还是天降的傲娇科学家战胜了呆萌青梅竹马。
】
额外的，在形而上的死亡那一章，感受到了一些别样的东西。就像是黑客帝国的尼奥一样，红蓝药丸的选择一样。
是否要坚持在虚假幸福面前装聋作哑，直到撑不住了就自暴自弃选择历史循环呢。
为什么该死的历史循环只存在这片大地呢。
相比于游戏，现实更为残酷呢。
有些人选择形而上的死亡，有些人选择自我放逐到一个新的世界，有些人选择成为共犯，但是再也看不到有些人去追求真实世界了啊，即使有也要被形而上死亡的人去辱骂污蔑，毕竟现实要比游戏困难。
我还是不想沉沦到形而上的死亡啊。

Ein wirklich gelungenes Stealth Adventure Game. Gut geschriebene Dialoge, sympatische Charaktere und eine gut Durchdachte Lore. Keine Ruckler oder Abstürze. Lief alles Butterweich.

Ghost of a Tale,tchinese,"優點
1.遊戲畫面很好，老鼠很可愛
2.遊戲地圖設計有點類似黑魂1

缺點
1.服裝雖然多，但是穿最長時間就軍鎧，縱使最笨重走最慢，
　還是會一直穿它，因為只有軍鎧能夠無障礙的四處走動。
2.軍鎧可以強化2次增加走速及快結束能夠拿到可以跑動的黃軍鎧，
　但是軍鎧2級和黃軍鎧都快接近遊戲尾聲才能獲得，
　導致遊戲長度有75%都只能靠軍鎧1級。
3.回復耐力時竟然要停止走動或蹲下才能回復，有點反人類。
　這種回復設定直接讓服裝加成變成沒用的東西，反正都要停下腳步才能回復。
4.燒旗幟時很常出現bug，明明把守衛引開了卻還是一直無法燒，
　一直出現有人盯著看的訊息，很惱火！
5.bug多，遇過比較嚴重的有青蛙那無法倒糞且沒反應，
　遊戲最後還未開箱就直接出現綠焰大軍，最好是開多存檔並且輪著存比較保險。
6.[中文語系]中文玩家才會遇到的事。
　有時中文會有嚴重的用字錯誤(看得出翻譯完後沒再進遊戲校對)，
　以至看不懂在說啥，如「騎上」垂暮燈火；實則要你跳上前方的垂暮燈火火爐。

Ghost of a Tale,japanese,"可愛いネズミのTiloくん（既婚）になって、囚われた妻を救うために奔走する背後視点ステルスアクションゲー。

登場人物の大半がネズミの世界観も作り込んでるし、苔むした倒木やら崩れかけた石垣やらビジュアル面はよくできている。ただし、褒められるのはそうした表面的な部分ばかりで、ゲーム部分はお世辞にも良いとは言えない。

グラフィックの密度が高いゆえに、そのまま広くすると作業量が膨れ上がるのを危惧したかマップが狭い。まともな移動速度なら5～6時間で終わる内容だと思う。にもかかわらずクリアまで17時間もかかったのはただひたすらに主人公の足が遅いから。

ステルスゲーなので敵兵に見つかると一方的に攻撃されるわけだが、敵兵自体もノタノタと歩いてしか追ってこない。しかもマップの各所に樽や棚などの隠れ場所があり、それらの中に入れれば100％ノーリスクで追跡状態が解除される。行き止まりにぽつんと置いてある棚ですら、中に入る瞬間さえ見られなければそれでいい。タタタッと駆け込んでさっと隠れられるのであれば敵兵の追走に意味がない。だから、足を遅くする。

足が遅いのは追われている時だけというのならまだしも、普段の探索中も遅いのでまったく話が進まない。

これを楽しめるのは、美点を注視することで欠点を視界から追い出せる、インディーゲー慣れした人だけだと思う。",

-------------------------------------------
由于游戏非常的出色，补充一下评测，自转A9VG论坛

最终版发售以后就开始抱着试一试的心情在玩，结果慢慢发现这游戏是披着卖萌外衣的硬核动作解密游戏。呆萌的主角的对手是红眼大老鼠，除了隐藏起来就是快速逃跑，快速跑动会像魂系列那样消耗体力槽，而游戏的体力槽跟HP又是共同的（体力槽恢复可以靠这种食物），所以，这游戏的难度算是比较大的。因为除了跟你可以交谈的npc，其余个个都是可以捏死主角的对手。游戏也提供了很多不同的装备，不同的装备对主角的参数影响很大，包括盔甲和布衣都有（有些npc必须穿正确的装备才能激活对话）。
为什么说玩这款游戏像魂系列的感受？
一、游戏难度比较大，需要玩家步步为营，存档机制靠躲在宝箱和睡觉以及npc对话方式存档，并不是随时可以存档。
二、解密方面比较有趣，可以说很硬核的解密，跟90年代pc上面的解密游戏很类似，各种对话，然后找道具拿钥匙，激活下一个区域，所以英文量还是比较大，另外中文会近期更新。
三、场景设计是真的让人眼前一亮。游戏开始主角是在一个又小又破的监狱里面，游戏几个小时以后，发现逃出了监狱以后不仅有城堡还有一个很大的后院；再游戏几个小时以后发现后院隐藏的小道出去还有偌大的海岛和一艘有故事的海盗船；然后继续游玩下去，发现还有非常大的地下城，说实话看到地下城的时候觉得就像魂一当初那种感受。
游戏里面主角的攻击方式非常的少，且需要消耗掉道具，如果提供武器攻击的话，真的就是黑魂的感觉了。另外，这款游戏的画面也可以说是很精致。

昨日通关了，后期确实赶工痕迹较重，文字量也较大，一些解密比较麻烦。如果有卡关什么的问题，欢迎咨询本人，看到了即刻解答",Wei Shi Yao Shuo Wan Zhe Kuan You Xi Xiang Hun Xi Lie De Gan Shou

Ghost of a Tale,schinese,"[b][h1]正式版后...[/h1][/b]
通关完感觉略惆怅，[spoiler]整个游戏讲的就是一只名叫Tilo的小老鼠在不断寻找家人的过程。游戏流程从逃出地牢监狱到最后逃出这个类似于监狱的小岛，途中获得了不少友谊（？）也见识过了关押他的‘恶势力’，每个角色都个性鲜明，有笑料有引人深思。故事最终Tilo继续踏上了寻找家人的新旅途...也就是说这故事还没完？？？[/spoiler]
ps: 以下擦黑部分不是什么剧透，都是些吐槽的废话。英文渣也搞不起什么英文评测，就中文凑合吧。

[b][h1]略感不足之处...[/h1][/b]
当前版本（6.5）bug较多，大多重启游戏或者读档就会恢复，少部分任务出bug的情况可能无法挽救，最好多存几个不同存档轮换用。
背景BGM太少，过场动画几乎等于没有。除了个别NPC对话有固定BGM外，偶尔换了地图区域也会突然出现BGM，大部分时候都没有BGM，还有部分过场动画也没有任何声音，不知道是不是BUG。

[b][h1]剩下的那必须都是优点！[/h1][/b]
游戏以潜行扮演为主，操作简单，整体难度偏低。没有太多战斗元素，怪AI都不高。有解密的部分也不难，实际上需要解密的部分会出现简单易懂诙谐逗趣[spoiler]容易被英文渣忽略掉[/spoiler]的文字或线索提示。
说到诙谐逗趣，这一点贯穿了整个游戏的各种任务与NPC的互动剧情，虽然文字量庞大，但是阅读起来并不容易感到烦躁[spoiler]因为语言问题阅读困难的除外[/spoiler]
需要来回跑地图，支线和收集品不少，满足收集癖欲望的同时在细节，人物和剧情设定上都做的很到位，并不会感到枯燥和单纯的刷刷刷[spoiler]就算是刷刷刷，看着这只小老鼠，枯燥什么的也不存在的[/spoiler]
画面和音乐对于小团队的独立游戏来说堪称惊艳，游戏中出现的游吟诗人歌曲都可以拿出来单独作为优秀的OST收藏。

总得来说这款游戏轻松休闲，老少皆宜，非常适合手残党玩家，不太适合硬核派玩家以及对老鼠无好感的玩家。
感觉目前作为正式版还是有略多不足，价格也略高，不过游戏的更新修复仍旧在频繁进行中，且作为对开发者团队的支持，强烈安利给同样喜爱这只小老鼠的人！
期待后续的更新。

PS：游戏目前有中文语言可以选，全是乱码尚未修复，对中文有要求的可以再观望观望。


[spoiler][b][h1]早期抢先版[/h1][/b]
花了差不多20小时玩完了这个体验版本，每一个角落都探索了，其他的就不说了，我只有一个愿望：将来能出中文版！

结果第二天就破功了，不光二杀杰克，连玛格丽特也一起给二杀了。第三天过了生日派对到了地下基地拿到了伊芙琳解药，第四天没玩多久就通关了。

为什么进度这么快呢？除了瘾大之外，很重要的原因是这个游戏玩着玩着就不恐怖了。主房子地下第一次见到菌怪的时候我开始疯狂sl来研究游戏机制：普通菌怪三发普通子弹爆头，发动机室的菌怪五发普通子弹或者一发散弹爆头。如果跟他玩跑酷会发现甩开一定距离或者玩家到了某些限制区域后菌怪就会融化，但是回来之后他们又会再站起来。因为离开较远所以不知道融化位置是否也是再站起来的位置。还有一个很重要的机制或者说漏洞，就是如果甩开跑酷到了下一个自动存档点之后，前面没有打的菌怪会消失再也站不起来，但是手动存档对此无效。

探索完这些之后，游戏的恐怖感就大大降低了，因为频繁重复sl之后就对场景产生了钝感。去二楼跟杰克躲猫猫还是比较吓人的，因为我也没去实验攻击杰克造成一定伤害会不会触发什么剧情，毕竟游戏前期物资紧缺，就算有什么成果也不可能付诸实践。其实躲猫猫桥段才是游戏中恐怖元素的精华，这个玩法也极度雷同逃生，不对称的pve对抗，只准怪打你不准你打怪。活着不难，难在虎口拔牙。在限制比较严格的条件下进行解密闯关，危险时刻在身后追击，心脏都要炸了。

可惜这个玩法毕竟不是生化危机的主轴，电锯砍完了杰克之后这个游戏就再也没能带给我逃生的感觉了，老房子的玛格丽特也有一段短暂的巡逻，但是她的活动范围实在是太小，而且虫群攻击对我的观感比起一个拿着斧头在身后追的疯子实在是差太远。也许怕虫子的人士会比较有感觉？手动@高中室友大芃爷。

我对整个老房子的大虫子、虫巢、虫群攻击都是比较没有感觉的，唯一印象深刻的地方就是自己蠢到拿着喷火枪对着虫巢一直烧直到全爆开，实际上喷火枪点燃之后等一等可以让他的后续燃烧伤害慢慢破坏，等火灭了再点燃，这样能节约1/3到1/2的燃料。当然了，和前面的跑酷刷菌怪消失一样没有太大意义，因为玩到通关剩下的弹药实在是太多了，只是因为前期不知道后面会有多么凶险所以必须步步为营。

温室二杀玛格丽特挺折磨的，第一次我散弹枪爆头，打空了弹夹都没打死。查查攻略原来要打腹部的人体虫巢，于是我打空了弹夹终于把她打死= =。没子弹了后面怎么办呢？于是我不信邪，又sl了几次终于在低受伤的情况下打死蜘蛛并且剩下九发散弹。好像是在这里我做了类固醇实验，众所周知类固醇可以加血上限，那么加的一格血量是满的还是空的呢，以及对于当前不满的血量会如何调整呢？作战中我受伤严重，实验发现注射类固醇之后可以补满血量，这对于三瓶药成就是非常有帮助的。前面还没注意到这个成就，好像是剧情骗我用了一瓶药，打剪刀手杰克的时候用了一瓶药（还都是低级药，心疼自己），第一个类固醇没想太多拿到直接打了，后面玛格丽特蜘蛛用了一个，打触手杰克的时候用了一个，还留了一个准备打伊芙琳时候用，没用上就通关了。在激情二选一之后伊森离线了一阵，回来之后也是自动回满血。

邪气的卢卡斯指引我们去找倒霉的警官时候，我本以为要二连boss了，毕竟杰克曾经对着他的尸体自言自语暗示这个人会回来？结果碰到的只是一些普通的菌怪。到这里好像已经看过生日快乐的录像了，包括老房子米娅的录像，我不太懂这个简单模式跑图的意义是什么，单纯降低难度？我倒宁愿录像是和现实无关，官方重复有些无聊。

整个测试区都比较无聊，按部就班爆头菌怪。见到了第一个胖子，走位下蹲躲呕吐物非常好打。到了最后也没跟卢卡斯正面交锋，倒是三刷了杰克，不知道为什么很多人都把这里的boss当成了卢卡斯。这个形态的杰克应该是本作的最强boss了，伤害高血量足，不防御两下一个小伊森，作为弱点的布满全身的眼睛不仅数量多而且还不容易打，很多是压在身下的，要等他自己翻身才能打到。这里我最强的武器是修复散弹枪和榴弹发射器，弹夹容量分别是两发一发，虽然打瞎一只眼睛杰克就会僵直，但相对的如果miss了要换弹就会遭受额外的攻击，容错率比较低。我到后来也没明白眼睛到底是两发散弹一个还是三发散弹一个，一开始如果足够快能在他第一爪之前把一只眼睛打爆从而令他僵直扫不住第一爪，但是好像头部是两枪解决不掉的，而关节处角度问题不好打，这里比较好的做法是往左边走掉下水，同样可以让杰克第一爪哑火。后面就重复换单打眼就可以，遇到攻击一定要防御，眼看快死了再打一发类固醇，慢慢熟悉boss机制就容易多了。相比之下打蜘蛛玛格丽特的时间要长的多，因为她吃两发散弹就会躲，而且血量也不比杰克少，只是她的伤害谈不上高，飞扑只要一直逃就很容易多，真正威胁是找来的大小虫子，而虫子的伤害就低多了。

激情二选一我选了佐伊，因为我从一开始就感觉米娅的五官有点丑，没有女生的精巧感，她的长相就是那种生孩子上了年纪一定会胖的感觉。第一次见佐伊是她被绑起来的时候从上往下俯视，这个角度看尖尖的鼻子非常秀气，但是到二选一的时候仔细看眼袋有点深，很瘾君子的感觉，也不好看了。尤其是在选的时候她听说只能救一人时候居然惊呼oh no，拜托，不是你刚才说让我用解药杀杰克的么？就很出戏。

佐伊的魅力还体现在全程心智正常，指引伊森逃出生天，轻微性挑逗的声音来打电话，还有房车里的可爱小胸罩太破防了。倒是有些奇怪全家操着南方口音怎么就她一个人说着标准英语？米娅的裸袖背心也挺性感，就很有女生单薄的感觉，亮丽的头发也让人把持不住，还有对伴侣的忠贞+牺牲，相比之下伊森跟佐伊说“Mia is no good to anyone”就很大猪蹄子了。

沉船也没什么意思，强行增加的物资紧缺感并不会造成困难，因为玩到这里我早就熟悉游戏机制了。解谜也没什么令人眼前一亮的地方，拿着机枪一路突突突就只是单纯地在空无一物的无聊和无双打怪的枯燥之间取得了平衡。杀米娅，进矿坑，又是一路突突突，最后发现原来频繁出镜的老奶奶就是伊芙琳，无脑爆头通关。美国大兵不灭口差评。

总的来说这个游戏还是没有跳出生化危机的本格玩法，因为这是我玩的第一部生化危机，我就拿他跟恶灵附身来比较好了。恶灵附身玩起来并不恐怖，原因就是小怪车轮战射击玩法以及困难的怪物设定将他的恐怖稀释了，当你因为反复sl而感到焦躁的时候一定不会在意怪物吐出来的汁液并且推理他早上吃了什么，而对于重复出现的几种简单怪物模型又因为弱小而不会对你造成太大的心理压力。不是说这种玩法不好，事实上就是这样简单的谜题简单的怪物击杀能够给人正面反馈，只是大家所惊艳的恐怖部分其实是前面的逃生玩法。

甚至就连剧情在我看也是虎头蛇尾的，前面客房的场景设计，第一卷录像创造的紧张感，地牢米娅被人拖走，杰克初登场的压迫，一家人温馨晚餐的小意外，神秘的痴呆老奶奶，神秘的佐伊来电，这些都为游戏创造了精彩的悬疑。反观游戏进行下去，剪刀杰克被打败就血腥有余恐怖不足，老房子的玛格丽特就是很本格的打怪游戏，生日快乐就是很本格的解谜游戏，船就是前两者结合，矿坑完成度比起前面明显不足，最后boss伊芙琳之弱令人大跌眼镜。而且这种把所有灾变事件都归咎于US人形兵器研究，而且还是灵异小女孩的剧情实在是太过俗套，真就照抄恶灵附身和逃生了。老奶奶是伊芙琳的设定也很反逻辑，伊芙琳心智很显然是小女儿，人体实验的时间应该也没过太久，不能理解为最初的实验体长大成了老奶奶，只能说伊芙琳想用老奶奶的形象来示人，理解不能。最后大兵没杀伊森也很难理解，这种国家机密甚至是丑闻的事件被泄露后果不堪设想，强行为了好结局抛弃逻辑。而且米娅的身份也很令人感兴趣，毕竟平民应该是接触不到这样的任务的。

最令我执念的是佐伊的结局，不算dlc看来佐伊真就石化在小船上了，而且最后米娅也没有活下来，看来这是官方钦定的坏结局了。可是凭什么呢？就为了惩罚没有从一而终？游戏创造两难的选择非常成功，但是没有给出两个令人满意的结局就不够高明了。暂且搁置，玩过dlc之后再正式评价。

总之，对这个游戏我还是非常满意的，昏暗环境给人画质好的欺骗感觉，场景设计细节丰富；慢速移动弥补了场景小的不足；射击、解谜中规中矩；人物设计丰满，角色个性分明令人印象深刻；剧情可以接受，神级开局庶民结尾；前面的逃生玩法和后面几个jump scare令人满意，只可惜这部分太少。本作是第一人称生化危机，但是相比第三人称差别仅仅是fov的缩小，并没有带来移动、打枪手感的提升。这也是ip包袱。本作并不完美，但是overwhelmingly positive当之无愧。

游戏最离谱的就是里面的npc双标了，npc敌人杀了就几点经验，npc市民杀了差不多就是一个或者几个boss的经验，这血液质量差异这么大？说起来也是挺倒霉，护士我放过了，然后第二天她就变了。圣徒我放过了，然后第二天他也变了，就离谱，我都不知道我是怎么在区域支柱都不在的情况下保持区域没有沦陷的。

Vampyr,schinese,"vampyr，感觉制作组下了很多心思，尽管表现出来的东西还是有点不尽人意，但意外的还挺好玩的

游戏印象最深的就是1918伦敦的主地图，整个地图的气氛渲染非常好，细节上也没什么可以挑剔的，导航系统也正常水准，加上游戏有大量开捷径的设计，基本是前期绕来绕去一本道，后期对着目标直线跑，[spoiler]这不是最后给我个主线任务叫我去跑地图互相远的不行三个点的理由[/spoiler]，不过总的来说地图场景上没什么毛病，很可惜为了给吸血鬼视觉（v）这个鸡肋功能点作用，游戏没有npc指引，否则寻路上还能再轻松一点

其次想说的就是战斗系统，这游戏建议困难起步，因为困难玩其实也还好，是个比较理想的不思考打会死的难度，再低就丢失乐趣了，常规的经营红蓝绿三条就不多说了，vampyr战斗系统最可惜的地方就是花拳绣腿不如一个闪躲轻击，游戏除了白嫖的绝招，主动技能就只有一个近战的利爪和回血的自噬是有用的。其他的血枪是远程要抬手时间，不是欺负远程兵一般抬手就被打断；暗影爆破也是抬手，抬手不说，爆炸延迟，范围还小，想炸一群人一般只能无锁定炸自己脚下，盾就一低配昆恩，控制么没经验加就时间短，突进隐身都没怎么用，感觉都不如直接跑，耐力加多了提着招架棍打起来感觉就像黑魂，滚和格反，老不死人了。前期试招时候被其他技能抬手时间弄气死了，后期对面有吸血鬼血裔用同款技能笑死了，暗影爆破这抬手加延迟真的能炸到谁啊。绝招感觉三个基本差不多，绝招嘛，后期怪多了以后日常起手看看能不能白嫖。再讲武器，游戏的枪感觉存在感极低，主要又弹药限制又要换弹，至少我全程就是近战晕咬核心，单手副手桩，双手招架棍，晕-咬-主动技循环，玩的挺开心，就是最终boss不吃眩晕，啃脖子啃了一路最后boss不能啃有点难受，要是玩攻击回蓝估计操作能更简单，砍人闪避回血就完事了

然后说rpg的对话交互和剧情，这游戏其实对话量很大，配音也挺有感情的，就是全员面瘫，后期救医生时候的对话甚至医生连气都不喘了，除了嘴什么都不动，着实把大家伙都逗乐了。男主说是医生，游戏流程里说好听叫经常上知乎的侦探，实际像街道查户口的大妈，平时张口就是你对这个什么看法，你觉得XXX怎么样，游戏的线索系统基本可以理解为通过对话/物品/文件解锁新的对话，线索内容包括但不限于调节父子、母子、夫妻感情，异性、同性交友，窥视他人隐私后站高地指责对方，一般可以归总为邻里八卦，这么看里德医生着实是伦敦之友，上医身体顽疾，下解家庭纠纷。剧情不知道是不是因为大家都面瘫，感觉平平淡淡普普通通没有悲喜，不过剧情上选项不少，影响对话篇幅不少而且游戏是过程影响的多结局设计，这点我还是挺喜欢的

其他还有点细节比如收集的文件分不清已读未读啦，潜行背刺因为收益太小鸡肋的不行啦，吸人系统有和没有没什么区别啦，吸血鬼视觉基本没用啦之类的就不高兴摊开来讲了，游戏就是很多展开的设计都有，但都做的很鸡肋，尽管不是关键系统并不影响游戏玩，但就算游戏难度高也很少用的到。反过来有的地方比如说游戏里人类势力和怪物势力会打起来，这游戏没有队友，后期敌人多的时候我经常把怪物引到猎人那里再一起捞，这种放现在普通但一般好游戏都应该有的设计他就有做；或者说游戏最后一幕，其实直接导入对话界面或者cg甚至ppt就能交代掉的事情，但他就做了一张不大不小蛮漂亮的城堡地图，其实能操作的部分也就放了一个谜题几个文件，细想还是蛮良心的

所以vampyr整体还行啦，节奏也比较紧凑，只是玩的过程里就感觉这游戏其实能做的更好，坑结尾也挖了，希望能有续作吧",

Vampyr,schinese,"还是要感谢官方中文，虽然很多游戏都有中文了，但我还是想谢谢。
本以为是奇异人生的开发商故事一定很有有意思，但是后来发现故事性并不是我想的那样。
我觉得我的预购有点可惜。
游戏流程较长，过完所有支线，大概要20小时？

游戏有很多优点：
1. 可以自由探索收集的剧情
2. 开放世界
3. 比较硬核的有体力槽的打怪方式
4. 细腻的画面，无论是从镜头还是模型还是贴图都像在看电影一样赏心悦目
5. 过场以实时演算为主，少数地方使用漫画叙述
等等

问题是，前三个优点混杂在一起，使得整个游戏显得不伦不类，让我很难坚持玩下去。
1.通过不断的对话探究剧情很有意思，也有些累，因为获得新线索不会再对应NPC身上显示，我要记住然后再找人对话，一堆支线任务意味着我有一堆剧情要记住，这已经很费神了。
2. 在费神了解剧情的同时还要研究怎么打怪，因为游戏故意设置的较高难度的打怪方式，如果等级不够高打上十几分钟也是有的。
3. 再加上开放世界却没有快速旅行。
结果就是，一个支线任务，5分钟对话，半小时跑路加打怪，再对话5分钟，再半小时跑回来继续对话完成支线。不伦不类，分不清楚游戏的核心是高难度打怪还是体验剧情。

游戏的场景人物都很有表现力，黑暗时期下的伦敦从剧情和人物上也被烘托的惟妙惟肖，这说明开发商的讲故事水平至少还是在的，有也足够的细节表现 [spoiler] 比如参加完妹妹葬礼绕了一圈回到墓地，我发现妹妹的墓地和棺材被翻得乱七八糟，在后续主线剧情中得知原来妹妹变成吸血鬼自己爬出来了 [/spoiler] 只是每段剧情都被漫长的跑路和打怪割裂开，实在没有办法沉浸体验。

游戏的内容过多，剧情后期可以看出一些赶工迹象，从第一个场景每个人物都有对话选项，到最后一个场景冒出好几个没有对话选项的NPC，过多的内容只会把制作者和玩家都搞累了，何必互相伤害呢lol

最后提一下这个游戏的的特色
1.不同的选择导致剧情变化。
这是我搜到的四个结局和解锁条件。https://www.steamxo.com/2018/06/10/227440 【国内可能打不开这个网站，你懂我意思吧】总的来说，就是四个地区的健康程度影响了最后得到四个结局中的哪一个，很多主线选择，好像无所谓的样子，我的选择是，护士魅惑，猎人放过，医生转化，牧师放过，道森魅惑。结局是两个人周游世界找解药去了。支线的那些选择只是继续支线任务的条件，选的好支线剧情就看的完整，不好就戛然而止，对主线和结局没什么影响大概。
2. 吸食市民可以变强。
这个完全是我根据观察瞎猜的，可以部分无视。我想说的是，主线敌人的等级是动态的，吃掉市民可以获得大量经验然后等级狂升，但是敌人等级一定会在你当前等级基础上，进行相应的调整。举个例子，我通关时22级，最终BOSS是30级，而我看到另一个人的截图，他46级，BOSS却是51级。所以我猜测并不存在等级低怪就难打，而是等级高一样难打。

最后，最后的BOSS战场景我真是太喜欢了，那一片血海特别有真实感，仿佛来到《闪灵》片场，爱了爱了。https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1296423688552606070/DF4BE11AD35E67D864E8F7DA32E9C120B24B3BFD/

总结，各方面都不错但是混在一起显得不伦不类的不知道是硬核动作还是剧情向游戏。",Wo Jue De Wo De Yu Gou You Dian Ke Xi  spoiler spoiler Zui Hou Ti Yi Xia Zhe Ge You Xi De De Te Se

Vampyr,schinese,"①游戏以西班牙流感爆发下的英国伦敦为大背景，架空世界观，描述了一场血与爱的战斗史。通过深度的剧情，多元素的对话线索，以及元素隐藏勾勒出一个有关于病毒，吸血鬼，人类的繁杂世界。
②先说下游戏的优点，那就是剧情了。游戏的剧情很容易让人沉浸其中，深邃而富有深度，以一个研究血液的军医变成吸血鬼为切入点，并以大量的线索对话元素相辅，使游戏的世界观极为立体，并且很容易就把自己带入游戏中。游戏其实可以当做一个剧情向的游戏游玩，其中不乏颇有创意的设计，游戏的世界观是活的，主角作为一名吸血鬼医生，不仅仅在主要剧情上需要作出自己的选择影响整个世界和剧情，还需要去几个地方分别治疗npc的病情，每个npc都可以杀害吸血获取经验，而病情就是影响npc经验的。并且每个npc都有大量的对话线索，和不同的npc谈话可以获取相关联npc的线索对话。可以说游戏整体世界观塑造的极为灵活，但相对应的就是游戏进程相对繁琐，元素堆积严重各个地方到处跑，npc来回对话会有点拖累游戏体验。
③为什么说游戏最好作为剧情游戏来玩，这不是动作游戏么？这就是Focus一直以来的问题了，游戏作品质量一直居于3A和独立游戏之间。其实两部奇异人生就有这样的问题，很多动作很僵硬，莫须有的空气墙，放在剧情选择游戏里无伤大雅，但在吸血鬼里是致命的。工作室作品剧情有多棒，战斗体验就有多糟糕，感觉可能是动作捕捉和判定设计的不好，游戏打斗动作极为僵硬，硬直也特别大。并且游戏还有一个致命的缺点就是没有快速移动，游戏需要大量的在几个图跑图，尤其是后期，需要一个任务跑几个居住区，游戏除安全区外的设计就是怪物重新刷新，然后造成游戏大部分游玩时间都在跑图上。
④总之，游戏作为一款少有的吸血鬼题材得作品，剧情深邃，世界观塑造的很有魅力，但相对应的元素堆积，战斗僵硬，没有快速移动无意义的重复跑图时间太长。就我个人体验来说我觉得还是很值得体验的，但这个价格绝对不值，折扣好的时候很建议体验一下。",

[h1][spoiler]🧛‍我就是卡关也不会去吸无辜市民的鲜血的！嗯，真香~🧛‍[/spoiler][/h1]

[h1]Vampyr 吸血鬼[/h1]
本作是由DONTNOD Entertainment制作，Focus Home Interactive发行的一款吸血鬼题材的剧情向RPG游戏，讲述了1918年的伦敦一位名叫乔纳森·里德的吸血鬼医生，为拯救被流感折磨已久的伦敦民众寻找治疗良药的故事。游戏的剧情内容不错，主线故事条理清晰，在一个不大的世界范围里，主角与众多npc之间的事件层层交织、关系复杂，可探索内容极多。除此之外，游戏还有完善的装备、技能以及战斗系统，整体表现十分不错，推荐给喜欢吸血鬼题材的RPG爱好者。

[h1]👉永不过时的吸血鬼题材👈[/h1]
“伦敦，1918 年。你是刚刚受拥化身的吸血鬼，乔纳森·里德医生。作为一名医生，你必须找到一种治疗方法，解救饱受流感折磨的市民们。作为一名吸血鬼，你的命运已经被诅咒，不得不将曾经发誓救助的人们当作食物。
你会拥抱潜藏在身心中的怪物吗？面对吸血鬼猎手、不死的血裔和其它的超自然生物。使用你的邪恶力量，操纵、研习你身边的人类，决定谁是你的下一个受害者。明智选择，挣扎求生……伦敦的命运是毁灭还是救赎，都取决于你的所作所为。”
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1997250344
游戏一开始的剧情可能让人摸不到头脑，主角里德从死人坑爬出来，刚刚变成吸血鬼的主角被欲望冲昏了头脑，上来就把自己妹妹吸了，除此之外没有太多关于背景故事的交代。之后边根据吸血鬼本能寻找血迹，边逃脱追踪，直到在后来慢慢安定下来之后，游戏构建的世界观才逐渐明了，人物关系才满满显现出来，而游戏的剧情目标也逐渐明确，找出瘟疫的源头、研究治疗的方法、查明自己沦为吸血鬼的原因。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1997257469
作为一个经久不衰的话题，本作为热爱吸血鬼这一题材的玩家构建了一个想象力十分丰富的伦敦城。在这里正值流感的时期，权力、金钱、欲望、诡计充斥着伦敦的夜晚，高层为了活命分隔疫区，为了长生而不择手段，每个人都藏着秘密，虽然嘴上不向外人透露，但是在暗夜里，主角里德正在默默观察着他们。除主角之外，游戏中的伦敦城里还有许许多多的吸血鬼同类，游戏还特地将吸血鬼种族做了分类，有主角一类的高等血裔，也有长相丑陋常发生变异的劣等血魔，以及身形庞大但又十分灵敏的混血狼种，因此也衍生出了吸血鬼内部以及与人类之间的种族纠葛，总体内容制作十分出彩。

[h1]👉游戏体验👈[/h1]

[b]1️⃣必不可少的一环--NPC[/b]
因为本作是一款剧情向的RPG游戏，所以玩家在游玩时一直要跟随主线剧情的引导，但除了主线剧情之外，游戏中还有不少支线任务以及隐藏内容。比如，序章之后的玩家是要开始从医院地区进行探险，而在医院里又有许多地方npc，这时玩家可以在前往剧情特定地点之前抽出时间与他们交谈，获取一些情报的同时也可以通过收集线索开启关于他们的隐藏任务。其实与npc的对话不会影响游戏主线内容，交谈的目的只是为了充实npc的人设以及玩家对于游戏背景内容的了解，玩家大可节省时间只推主线，不过也会因此错失不少奖励以及很多有趣的故事。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1997257774
[b]2️⃣一言难尽的战斗探索[/b]
作为一款RPG，战斗与探索自然十分重要。玩家在跟随剧情推进的同时需要前往不同的地区开展任务，但因为游戏背景（地区封锁）的原因，前往剧情地点的路途并不是一帆风顺的，除了要面对人魔两种敌对势力，错综复杂的城中小道以及锁住的铁门也是玩家需要面对的障碍，即便玩家锤光路上所有敌人，走到头发现门锁着（游戏中很多门都是只能先从另一边解锁，只有解锁之后才可以双向通过）又只能再绕一圈前往指定地点，如果绕完圈忘记来解锁的话，下次还得绕远路，这一设定大大拖慢了游戏的节奏。不过玩家大可不管城中的敌人，直接冲往剧情地点，但是很多时候玩家会被敌人锁定，而被敌人锁定时又tmd不能开门，所以只能被迫战斗...
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1997893660
说到游戏的战斗，只能暂定为中规中矩，打击感比较平庸，敌人攻击模式比较单一，不过玩家却有各种各样的技能可以学习，还可以收集种类十分丰富的近战武器、副手武器以及远程武器，通过技能以及武器的配合打出连招。值得一提的时，游戏中的一些武器隐藏在十分特殊的位置（比如在地下圣殿的一把剑，需要玩家踩机关开始石门之后才能获得，详情请看全成就的指南），不同武器的操作手感也不同，玩家还可以通过改装升级武器获得伤害以及其他属性的加成，不过这些都需要收集足够的材料才可以在工作台进行。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2001600851
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1997257741
[b]3️⃣地区沦陷以及“血拥”[/b]
主角作为一名吸血鬼自然拥有许多人类不曾拥有的能力，其中一项就是“魅惑”，玩家可以选取合适的npc（魅惑等级需要在主角魅惑等级之下才可以将其魅惑）将其魅惑之后施以“血拥”，获取经验值。所谓血拥其实就是吸血将其杀死，玩家可以通过这一方式快速获取经验值以供技能解锁以及升级，不过随之带来的就是有关此npc的任务内容都会消失，而npc所处地区的稳定程度也会降低。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2001600830
当地区稳定程度降低到最低时，此处地区则会“沦陷”。此时，街道中将遍布敌人，地区内所有npc都会消失，有关内容也随之消失，玩家也不能在这里获取经验值以及进行交易。决定地区沦陷等级的因素除了有npc的存活数量之外，与其健康程度以及在地区中的地位也有关，如果此npc在地区属于“中流砥柱”的地位，玩家将其血拥之后，此地区的稳定值则会大幅降低。而健康程度则与玩家的选择有关，在游戏中，许多npc会带有一些例如头痛、感冒之类的疾病，不仅影响血液质量，还会降低地区稳定程度，因此玩家可以在工作台中制作药方，交付npc来提供治疗。不过游戏中的药方需要通过玩家研究特定血液样方之后才能解锁，各类药方的制作也需要相应的材料。


总的来说，本作是一款质量十分不错的RPG游戏，虽然在战斗以及画面上有一些小瑕疵，不过整体的游玩体验还是十分不错的，剧情的叙述条理清晰十分完善，给玩家很强的代入感，游戏性也很强，在经典RPG的同时又能带来不少新鲜感。虽然售价不低，但史低71的价格也是非常香了，强烈推荐给喜欢吸血鬼题材的玩家。

Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight,tchinese,"《Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight，Momodora：月下安魂曲》是一款點陣風格的橫向捲軸遊戲，是 Momodora 系列的第 4 代，故事敘述主角嘉穗的家鄉受到蔓延的詛咒影響，所以出發尋求解決之道，展開一路旅程。本作在原有的基礎加上 Metroidvania 的遊玩要素，非線性過關流程，玩家可以隨意探索，收集過關物品，劇情上也比前幾作黑暗（主角是前幾作中的傳說人物，這代與前幾作雖然沒有直接關連，但有間接關聯）！！雖然遊戲對 NPC 的故事著墨不多，但各角色都很鮮明，很有特色，而且遊戲中對職業的稱呼全都有加上女性修飾詞，表示幾乎都是女角！！另外，這個系列有個有趣的設定，主角是祭司，手持楓葉戰鬥，這代還多了弓箭，這代本體根本是弓箭啊 XD

遊戲的操作性很流暢，打擊感也很強。遊戲整體難度算是不低，但比起前幾作算是友善許多了，而且有難度可以調整，不論手不手殘應該都是能盡情享受遊戲的，喜歡挑戰的玩家也有超高難度可以玩，是一款很不錯的作品。話說，這款遊戲埋了不少彩蛋，而且還有隱藏結局，還有稱得上隱藏 BOSS 的環節，各位就自己多多探索囉。

PS. 1、2 代為免費遊戲，可以在 itch.io 下載。3 代的話 Steam 上也有賣，有興趣可以自行搜尋一下。前幾作玩起來很像 Cave Story 這種風格的遊戲。

Youtubers Life,schinese,"[quote=爱の榨汁屋] 感谢 [h1]爱の榨汁屋[/h1] 提供的评测机会	[/quote]
[u] 在人前我光彩耀人，是个倍受瞩目的油管主
在人后我朝九晚五，是个忙得不停的小社畜[/u]


[h1]从零开始的油管主之路[/h1]
游戏提供了捏脸与不同的主播路线供玩家选择，每个不同类型的主播游玩体验都不一样，由于我只通关了音乐主播的路线，因此该评测会着重讲音乐主播的游玩体验。

一开始，玩家只能在家里弄视频，电脑配置差，拍摄工具烂，能得到的播放量也屈指可数。为了提升知名度，玩家必须购买新音乐的版权进行翻唱，并不断完善自己的硬件，当然这一切也不是白给的，玩家还得想办法赚钱来购买。

就这样，从无到有，一步步发展起来，我甚至能产生了这样一丝幻想——我要成为大油管主了！
但现实往往是残酷的
...
妈妈：“害搁那拍视频呢，滚去学习！”

没错，你还是个住在家里的学生，除了拍视频和赚钱你还得挤出时间学习，每个月都会有考试，一旦没考上，母上大人会毫不客气地没收你电脑。

好不容易赚够钱能搬出去住了，却有了个毫不害臊喜欢占用东西的宿友（这个宿友自从我搬家之后雷打不动动，请又请不来，电话又不接），本来在家免费的食物也得自己花钱买，更别提每个月还得交房租和合伙人的工资呢。

不仅如此，从成为油管主的第一天起，我的生物钟已经被打乱了，有时候白天累得要睡觉，大晚上熬夜录视频，车轮战般的学习和工作。整个过程都很紧凑，要求玩家把握好每一分每一秒，几乎没有放松的时候，一件又一件事扑面而来，让人根本停不下来，爆肝就完事了。



[h1]我是无情的社交机器[/h1]
游戏除了日常的工作外，社交也尤其重要。但游戏设计的社交模式却是极其枯燥无聊，还耗费时间的。
https://steamcommunity.com/id/107438/screenshot/776236552228520366
为了和一个人交朋友，你得疯狂和他聊天，还得顺着他的兴趣聊，通过聊天增加好感度来增进关系，最后甚至能结婚。但聊天的过程纯粹是极其无聊的刷好感的过程，玩家无法看到聊天内容，只能看到两个小人在那做表情和大笑，而刷好感这个过程也是极其无聊且漫长的。
https://steamcommunity.com/id/107438/screenshot/776236552228518736
除了身边的朋友，你还得和网上粉丝互动，每隔一段时间就得发推维持热度，而且发推过于频繁反而会适得其反。

你还得和音乐公司和网络公司搞好关系，翻唱他们的音乐，使用相关产品，完成他们的任务，增加公司好感度以获取免费的版权和更多的福利。

总的来说，你不能整天宅在家里做视频，还得应付繁琐的社交，这个过程真实，但也令人厌烦。



[h1]肉眼可见的成长，向太空进发！[/h1]

每一个视频的发布，都能给玩家带来关注量。随着玩家的不断成长，视频的质量也越来越好，收益也越来越高。在频道页面玩家能清楚看到自己在油管排行榜的排名，不得不说，不断创造新视频来超过一个又一个主播，从量变到质变的感觉真的很棒。
https://steamcommunity.com/id/107438/screenshot/776236552228515875

到了后期玩家甚至可以组建属于自己的视频团队，与合作伙伴一起为频道添砖加瓦。

而且随着频道知名度的提升，你可以不断换更好更大的房子，最后甚至能住进空间站上太空，为了目标砥砺奋进吧！

这款游戏在成长与经营方面的玩法丰富多彩，多样化的设计总能让玩家找到活干而不置于闲下来无所事事，快节奏的成长更是让玩家欲罢不能。


[h1]关于游戏的一点吐槽[/h1]
先说说游戏的核心问题，那就是过高的重复度。游戏从前期到后期核心模式还是一成不变的，增加的许多新功能反而都是为拍视频这个核心模式服务的，而且越后期游戏节奏就越紧凑，玩家忙得不可开交，很可能就会丧失继续肝下去的动力。
游戏的社交问题上面也提到了，耗费时间且毫无趣味，除了建立合作伙伴，社交的收益似乎并不高。
然后就是游戏越后期越多的bug，后期经常出现人物不动，关系条不显示，对话卡住不跳成就等问题，但大部分只需退出菜单重进游戏即可解决。

还有就是游戏中完全不到位的教程，很多主线任务和功能完全没有教程，只能靠玩家自己摸索，导致很多不必要麻烦。

[h1]总评：[/h1]
这款游戏在成长与经营方面的玩法丰富多彩，多样化的设计总能让玩家找到活干而不置于闲下来无所事事，快节奏的成长更是让玩家欲罢不能。即使存在模式重复性高，内容单一，但对单纯喜欢经营模拟的玩家还是有极大吸引力。游戏提供了四个职业，每个职业游玩体验都有所不同，且游戏一直还在更新，不排除未来还有更多丰富的职业与玩法，总的来说依然是一款值得游玩的经营游戏。

也许对于很多BANDAI的粉丝，或者说传说系列的粉丝来说，或许本作谈的上优秀，但诚然对我而言，看到二周目继承存档时那夸张的点数需求，就想到了一周目我到底有多少事情没有干完，以及又要花多少时间来肝二周目。

整体上能看出制作组的用心，但不用心的地方也比比皆是，省钱的建模甚至在槽点中都排不上号。
也不知道是不是自己真的老了，在面对RPG这个曾经自己深爱的类型游戏时，甚至不舍得腾出30个小时来通关。至于是不是真的如此，就等下一次肝同类型游戏时再做比较了。",

Tales of Berseria,schinese,本来看评论里面说跑步模拟器，我觉得玩了这么多游戏，跑图远的算什么，无主不也满地图跑吗？结果我真的是被震惊了，真就只能跑啊，地图还那么大，打完BOSS都不剧情一下传送回去，还得跑，腿都跑断了。这游戏的战斗系统不是很舒适，自制连招不一定好用，每个招式都有克制的对象，知道敌人的类型还可以配招，不知道的话，欸。。。装备系统也做的很麻烦，强化装备的材料除了分解装备，基本路上就很难捡到，而且装备基础属性和稀有度不匹配，还得自己根据自己的战斗风格仔细配，挺麻烦的。优点的话，剧情吧，我基本都是为了看剧情才继续打下去了。,

狂战传说可以说是让我印象非常深刻的游戏之一了，唯一可惜的是没能一口气通关，身心完全投入之后会很疲惫，再想玩这款游戏却又拿不出足够的时间和专注力

日本的RPG很擅长用朴实无华的故事内容刻画每一个角色的个性，而每个角色在日常中所表现的只是你看见的，你厌恶的某个角色可能在日后某一天被“洗白”了，或许让人欣喜或许让人讨厌，但这正是现实生活中存在的让很多人忽视的东西，没有人生来就是杀人犯，你所厌恶的只是与你理念不合的他人的行为与行为方式
举以上这么个例子你能明白我要说什么吗？
作为灾难源头的主角与各路反派角色因为各自的理念集体讨伐人类的救世主，正义vs邪恶，其实很像是理性vs感性，当人类的大义与个人的利益冲突时，你又会怎么决策？

严重剧透：关于剧情，个人认为[spoiler] 如果姐夫贯穿真正意义上拯救人类的信念，可能故事会更精彩吧 [/spoiler]

Tales of Berseria,schinese,"[h1]《狂战传说》-反英雄的复仇之旅[/h1]

前言:
本作为我接触到的第一款传说系列的游戏，也是让我成为传说粉的一作，尽管跑图过程有些枯燥，但剧情的精美绝伦也让我游玩的过程大呼过瘾，对我来说，这就像是一款把番做成游戏，自己亲自操控主角来经历种种故事的游戏。

[h1]剧情[/h1]
这是一场“反派”拯救世界的故事（雾）
作为日式RPG常用的设定，本作的故事背景也是处于架空时代（非要说的话就是有魔法，有魔物的类中世纪背景）。女主薇尔贝特的姐夫阿尔托琉斯将弟弟当作祭品杀害，薇尔贝特也因为充满愤怒与憎恨成为了噬魔，虽然在那天之后，对魔士的出现为世界带来了安全，阿尔托琉斯也因此被封为了导师，但这种利用自己弟弟换来的荣誉，是绝对不能容许的，复仇之旅也就此展开。
在剧情讲述部分，是以“立绘文字式”“即时演示式”“动漫插入式”三种形式进行演示的，一些小剧情是以纯对话的方式进行讲述。经费最足的还是动漫插入式了，简直要吹爆，动漫里的薇尔贝特漂亮极了，可惜动漫插入并不是很多，大部分都是以动态立绘+文字以及即时演示作为讲述剧情的主体。

[h1]日式角色扮演[/h1]
作为一款JRPG，该有的要素都有，主要玩法还是打怪-升级-养成-过剧情，地图为剧情解锁制，部分地图场景在进行某部分剧情时是无法回去的，支线任务并不多，但也有几个。城镇倒是蛮多的，并且特色也刻画的很好，场景里也放了很多宝箱等着玩家去探索，NPC们差不多都有对话，还有很多小剧情可以了解，以及小游戏，是的......你还可以打牌，竞速，在酒馆当工具人给人端菜，看憨憨大叔变脸等等。

[h1]战斗/操作[/h1]
本作是明雷遇敌模式，需要进入独立场景再进行战斗的半即时制，战斗途中可以换角色，且能使用道具，打斗方面讲究的是连招与心魂爆发，记得看下敌人的弱点，也许可以利用弱点打的更加轻松些，而且时长要注意攒蓝开大，一顿猛就完事了，操作建议用手柄，键鼠的话可能有点蛋疼。

[h1]迷宫/跑图[/h1]
迷宫部分的设计是我最不喜欢的了，换皮的机关，枯燥无味的野怪挡路，缓慢的跑图速度，散落在场景中吸引你捡的猫魂，都能成为强行拖慢游戏进程的因素，整个游戏唯一的交通工具还得打到中期才给，且不能直接就通用，想全地图通用的话，还得去场景里找解锁点，有些解锁点都放在迷宫的深处，你还得先跑大段路找到解锁点才能使用滑板，而且滑板的速度还并不是特别快......总的来说，跑图过程很枯燥，有几个地方差点让我玩睡着，常常都是跑图半小时，剧情十分钟。

[h1]人物/CV[/h1]
在剧情上，本作对于每个人物的特色塑造的都很成功，即使是配角的故事都很完善，能让你深深记住，有这样一个角色，我个人记得最深的就是玛琪露了，这货感情戏真多2333333
CV方面，一开始我一直觉得女主薇尔贝特的声音很耳熟，后面去搜了一下，给我吓一跳，佐藤利奈的声优，顺便看了下其他角色的声优，光是角色里我都能看到三个超电磁炮里的声优，黑子，女王的都有，还有个轻音少女的，游戏内配音质量极高，吹爆，感情都很足。

[h1]“你觉得，鸟儿为什么会飞？”[/h1]

这样一个疑问，贯穿了整个游戏。
游戏从头到尾都围绕着“法理”与“情理”为玩家们讲述着有关自由的意义与不懈追求。

[h1]“鸟是因为想飞才会在天空飞，不需要理由，就算可能会折翼而死也无所谓，不为任何人，也不是因为任何人的命令，鸟只是因为自己想飞才在天空飞。”[/h1]

没有绝对的邪恶，也没有绝对的善良，每个人都有自己的理由，为了自己的想法，去做某件事，任何事情都是事出有因。但也正是因为如此，人们才会产生争执，只是因为你我认为，想做的事，不一致，亦或是影响到了对方，与此同时，也就出现了法理，这个能够维持秩序的东西。
但如果一切都按照束缚人们行为的法理来，而非自由，人们，还能活的自在吗？
如果说，这种拥有感情，拥有自由，真正活着的世界是地狱，那我宁愿一辈子都待在地狱，死在地狱了。
秩序与自由本就该互相扶持，任何一方的绝对主义，都是影响世界运转的毒瘤。

作为一款日式角色扮演，狂战传说非常优秀，出色，值得热爱JRPG的玩家一试。

[h1]个人评价总分：〖10/8〗优秀之作，值得一试的好作品。[/h1]

推荐情况：特别推荐//打折

Tales of Berseria,schinese,"完结撒花！！！！
本来以为流程没有这么长（因为看评论里面很多30小时通关的朋友）结果一下子。。感觉要完美开二周目刷刷刷的话，我还得再玩10小时。。。

      先写给没玩过的小伙伴建议：想真正投入和体验这游戏的战斗系统的话，难度选进阶，想自己研究配装和技能搭配就继续往上选，（反正随时能改），DLC第一个68块钱的包最好买了很好用。（熟练度和经验之类的双倍都点上，直升等级和加血上限可以留着别用）我是进阶难度，冒险DLC双倍全选的。感觉正正好（也就是大部分同阶装备专精完正好打BOSS），打起怪来不至于太无聊，经验也挺多的不需要太多的无脑刷浪费时间，更何况好多随机技能只有难度增加了才会给。另外还有个钓鱼卡角色的BUG，规避的办法是看到钓鱼小游戏了不要玩（实在想玩STEAM切成英文再回去玩），我下面加粗也提到了。

      那么首先作为一个日产游戏，[h1]战斗系统[/h1]可以说是超乎想象的棒了，最令我吃惊的是：每个角色虽然有一样的能量系统，但是玩法上大不一样，装备专精技能，随机技能，强化后出现的技能，配合称号系统，基本上打造出来的角色各有特色。
玩起来的感觉就是：认真研究作战系统的话很有成就感，发现越多乐趣越多，然而无脑刷刷居然也很能体会到角色养成的乐趣。做到这两点上的平衡其实并不容易。和画面差不多的海王星系列对比，战斗系统要好一大大截。
       不过游戏中，中规中矩而且同模也挺多，基本上花费时间的也就是迷宫探索，战斗刷等级和刷装备熟练度（也正因为战斗系统做的好，所以刷起来不会太腻，这点好评，当然前提是难度开进阶以上）
       [h1] 而在剧情上，[/h1]比之前的传说系列还是有提高的。起码不是正统的正义战士一路走来打败邪恶的剧本（和前座形成鲜明对比233）不展开啦。值得一提的是，路程上的一些（其实在游戏里面的感觉是很多了）小剧情小对话更是有趣，丰满了人物形象，也让我玩的时候在战斗之余有效放松，搭配合理。不过这几项确实也是日产游戏的老牌手段了。

这样看下来，这两点特色已经对得住这个好评了。

      [h1]缺点的话，[/h1]还是游戏的画面和建模之类的太简陋，虽然说和欧美大厂没啥可比性吧，但总觉得很糙，草草做成的样子。不过日厂游戏本来就不是靠那些玩意吃饭的。另外，迷宫做的有点长了希望能短点，老是在跑路，怪有的挺好的我想拉几个拉几个，想打就打。但最后一关迷宫又绕，怪又麻烦还多，就很难受了，有种——知道是最终关啦你肯定要打完所以强行恶心你一波hhhh，的感觉= =。装备系统和外观分开的，唔，我还是喜欢能做穿衣纸娃娃（不过这个是日厂通病了）   [b]哦对了，有个钓鱼BUG一直没修复（繁中下点钓鱼会角色卡死，害我没存档重跑了一边路）还是希望能引起重视。毕竟这BUG在主线必经之路，每个新人玩这游戏几乎都要被这个BUG恶心一次吧。 [/b]

这次写的比较琐碎了。但打穿之后觉得这游戏的质量确实原价入也是不亏的，不过现在作为一个年前的游戏，我是打折到75%OFF入的，要说，用差不多价格买个自己图新鲜的早期测游戏做对比[spoiler]——比如和我之前买那个The Universim对比QAQ[/spoiler]，狂战传说的性价比绝对可以算超值了。",Wan Jie Sa Hua  Zhe Yang Kan Xia Lai Zhe Liang Dian Te Se Yi Jing Dui De Zhu Zhe Ge Hao Ping Liao

Avorion,schinese,"在摸索了30小时之后我发现Avorion制作组的想法真的很多，后者在玩法上非常像各方面改进过的[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820/X3_Terran_Conflict/]Egosoft X3[/url]，还增加了完全自由的方块化造船、造空间站甚至造炮塔（听说最新的X4也有模块化建造的能力）

+ 随机生成的宇宙，规模高达100万个星区，除了星门也有虫洞实现长距离旅行，不过大多数是无星门需要自行跳跃的星区
+ NPC势力繁多，关系复杂，有如同文明6的喜好特性
+ 方块化造船、造空间站、造炮塔，极度自由，并且可以保存蓝图，分享给别人
+ 所有飞船都有短距离跳跃的能力、加力燃烧器，可以自由传送到自己的任何飞船上，无视距离，但飞船跳跃没有X3方便，X3电池带够可以跳到全宇宙任意一个角落
+ 船员、改装件的作用相当于X3的各类软件，顺带一提船员需要定期给薪水
+ 装备（炮塔、改装件）有品质之分，像网游那样的绿蓝紫橙，橙色品质的还附带白装没有的特效
+ 工厂制造业规模比X3更庞大更复杂，我看了一眼炮塔蓝图的制造材料发现这游戏的制造业不会简单...
+ 同样存在指挥舰队的玩法
+ 社交功能不简单，有网游式的聊天框，和信息分类
+ 多人模式可以像EVE那样组建公司（军团）
+ 支持GUI缩放，2k/4k高分屏的文字不会觉得小
+ 信息窗口可拖曳，玩过X3的自然懂
+ 有对比装备信息的功能
+ 拾取物品的声音和Minecraft一模一样，特别亲切
+ 存档文件结构也类似Minecraft，一个星区（对应MC的区块）一个文件，感觉有好有坏，好处是删文件重置星区，坏处感觉是去的星区多了存档体积上GB

- 没有云存档，原因前面说了，存档有可能太大，所以我觉得这是一个可以理解的缺点
- 飞船操控的便捷性比X3稍差，鼠标飞行没有加速、减速到特定速度的能力，键盘飞行模式有，或许将来的版本会支持？
- 没有导航路线的设定，这点很不好，跳一个星区就得开星图确认一下位置
- 中文输入支持不佳，看不见候选词，蓝图以中文名保存，游戏外的文件名是乱码
- 任务指引不佳，任务做完回来交任务，居然没有标记是哪个空间站，要仔细核对空间站名字才能确认",Tong Yang Cun Zai Zhi Hui Jian Dui De Wan Fa  She Jiao Gong Neng Bu Jian Dan You Wang You Shi De Liao Tian Kuang He Xin Xi Fen Lei  Duo Ren Mo Shi Ke Yi Xiang eveNa Yang Zu Jian Gong Si Jun Tuan  You Dui Bi Zhuang Bei Xin Xi De Gong Neng

Watch_Dogs 2,schinese,"[h1] 旧金山旅游模拟器[/h1]
做风景这一块育碧还是拿捏得死死的，狗2呈现了非常真实漂亮的旧金山景色，高画质下光照阴影细节到位，配合ansel的截图甚至可以媲美真实照片以假乱真（成功骗到了朋友）
二代是以拍照的形式打卡景点，在游戏里跟随二狗子的视角在旧金山各处包含金门大桥，唐人街，斯坦福大学，恶魔岛，彩绘女士等旅游景点拍照纪念，真有“云旅游”的感觉，游戏里拍照打卡后还会看到类似朋友圈其他角色的留言，也是非常贴近现实生活了。

[h1] ‌与一代完全不同的故事氛围[/h1]
‌一代以复仇为主题，剧情氛围严肃压抑，艾登的人物形象也深入身心，而二代却是完全不同的风格，首先主角团的形象就非常嘻哈风，色彩鲜明的衣服，斜挎背包，鸭舌帽，时刻戴着耳机，感觉随时可以来一段rap，Dedsec成员日常打趣诙谐幽默的对话，加上旧金山整体活泼明亮的色调，奠定了二代轻松欢快的氛围，剧情也比较简单，讲述黑客团体Dedsec粉碎不法团体利用ctOS2.0来操控市民的数据，扰乱社会秩序的阴谋，向大众公开真相。故事相对一代较为平淡，人物刻画也比较薄弱，一样有角色牺牲也没有一代克拉拉的死来得震撼难受。但我还是挺喜欢Dedsec团队之间的感情，乔许觉得自己犯错后所有人都来安慰，扳手被抢了面具后小马第一时间想着偷回面具，最后小马被通缉其他成员利用各自优势帮助小马，还有小马跟席塔拉之间互开玩笑也为游戏增添了不少笑点。

[h1]可玩性相较一代提高，黑客入侵玩法丰富[/h1]
‌二代的可玩性很高，玩法比一代丰富不少，黑客技术升级，装备也有了很大提升，给了玩家更多操作的空间。这代可以控制移动的大小升降机，起重机来达到更高的地方，可以控制车辆的转向，可以给路人报假警让警察抓，可以开展一次帮派斗争，给开放世界增加了许多乐趣。
一代只能利用摄像头观察黑入，二代增加了无人机和小车，无人机可以标记观察敌人，远程黑入，小车功能更强大，可以捡物品，远程和实体黑入，升级后小车和无人机还能丢炸弹，所以过关方式多种多样，可以让小马不用出场静静躲在某个角落，用无人机观察地形和敌人后全程用小车黑入，小车可以干扰设备和敌人，场景内还有很多专门供小车走的暗道，可以来无影去无踪的完成任务；不喜欢小车也可以肉身潜入，体验现代刺客的快感；喜欢突突突也可以直接杀进去，但是有些敌人很硬，硬刚还是有难度，最好是配合干扰打，重甲的敌人干扰一下就可以近战敲死了。场景内也有些可以控制的陷阱，比如敌人路过的时候炸一下，还能用小车无人机丢炸弹炸，总之如何过关还是在于玩家的喜好了。

[h1]不乏味的收集[/h1]
地图上没有无用的收集品，都是外观，钱或者技能点数，钱和外观的位置一般比较好找，大部分在敌方区域用小车拿了就跑，技能点数和重要数据的位置就比较刁钻了，先用无人机观察一下位置，看周围有没有可以黑入的升降机之类的设备，有没有小车走的暗道，小车升级之后弹跳力很强，加上冲刺能跳很远，所以多利用小车加周围环境，思考怎么拿点数也是我觉得这游戏很有意思的地方。有时候会遇到需要连线，这代连线是立体绕着建筑物，我反而觉得比一代平面连线简单了，有计时的都很少，就是找结点麻烦一点，没遇到过特别难连的，一代找齐二维码之后那个连线我人都连傻了…

[h1]支线和其他任务[/h1]
支线任务数量不多，要开了透析后去闪橘色光的路人处接，有些支线内容挺丰富像主线一样，有些就很短了，前期接到一个涂鸦任务可以先做，那个涂鸦都是在很高的地方，可以熟悉一下怎么利用环境上高处，还有个黑入育碧的支线（我黑我自己），一些支线还是比较有意思的，地图上还有很多在线模式任务可以两个人联机玩，也有一些竞赛活动，我没怎么玩，还有滴滴打车任务可以赚点外快。

VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,schinese,"《Va-11》之于赛博朋克给人的感觉，有点像是《武林外传》之于中国武侠。

比起威廉吉布森自《神经漫游者》起给赛博朋克确定下的高格调，《Va-11》中发生的故事更有一种市井的烟火气息。确切的说——

[h1]狗尿与肥皂的味道。[/h1]

是的，游戏中依然有猛男雇佣兵与巨乳黑客；依然有着消费主义下人的异化；依然有着stand alone complex造就的虚拟化身；在寥寥几张像素风CG中依然有着视觉奇观 以及大部分符合大众心中想象的时髦元素。

但作者却将幕光灯聚焦在Jill——一位不能再普通的调酒师身上。

对她而言，每天最头痛的不是怎么撬开上市公司的保险箱，而是这个月三十号要缴的房租；时局的动荡意味的不是翻身发财的机会，而是酒馆外随时可能飘来的子弹。在不得不面对自己的过去时，头疼的也不是身上莫名其妙多出来的AUG，而是大都数人都会面对的情感问题。

这与我们曾经扮演的Adam Jensen，或即将扮演的V相比，是两种截然不同的人生。

每天晚上，都有各式的追梦人抱着破败不堪的心理前往Valhalla，借助酒精寻找精神的慰藉。而Jill作为招待每一位顾客的调酒师，则有机会与玩家一起，在短暂的交集中聆听他们的故事。聊天过程中穿插的调酒在缓解长时间阅读的疲劳感之余，也给了玩家揣摩人物真实的情感的机会。

这使得Jill便成为了传奇与平凡的衔接点。

每一位酒客的故事，都多少承载了些属于赛博朋克的文化符号。但随着时间的推移，酒客们身上的传奇色彩逐渐被量大管饱的电子乐与黄段子所稀释，他们的内心如同洋葱一样被逐渐剥开。你会开始记住他们的爱好与性格，体会他们的喜怒哀乐，去试图梳理角色之间错综复杂的关系，同时也好奇隐藏在Persona下角色真正的面孔。

这种对人物多层次的细致描写，让游戏中出现的角色不再是假大空的符号，而是多少都为生活的琐事所困扰的普通人。大时代洪流下人物的身不由己，既是对世界观复杂性的尊重，也让故事有了更真实可信的质感。而恰到好处的留白，也使得各个角色在通关后依然有着值得玩味的空间。

尽管在游戏的过程中依然会有与同类型题材相似的无力感，但终究，这是个waifu游戏，落脚点终究是温情的。

即使生活以痛相吻，Jill依然有奶子与美酒相伴。
不像坐在屏幕前玩家，可能依然是个处男。",alone Yi Ji Da Bu Fen Fu He Da Zhong Xin Zhong Xiang Xiang De Shi Mao Yuan Su  Zhe Yu Wo Men Ceng Jing Ban Yan De adam Zhe Shi De jillBian Cheng Wei Liao Chuan Qi Yu Ping Fan De Xian Jie Dian  Ji Shi Sheng Huo Yi Tong Xiang Wen jillYi Ran You Nai Zi Yu Mei Jiu Xiang Ban  Bu Xiang Zuo Zai Ping Mu Qian Wan Jia Ke Neng Yi Ran Shi Ge Chu Nan

Day of Infamy,schinese,"-脱胎于《Insurgency2》，可以看作是它的二战版本。背景放在了西线，十分想念71发的PPS41和政委的口哨。

-2017年发行的游戏，热度早就过了（或者说压根就没热过？）官匹基本=单机，部分社区服务器部分时段有玩家，但是来来去去就那么几个熟悉的ID，总能不经意地凑到一起，能坚持偶尔来玩几局的应该都是纯爱吧。

-这游戏的Bot有BUG，线下到最后一个据点双方Bot经常会卡在刷新点不出门。困难的Bot准头真的高，但普通Bot的反应也真的慢，你到刷新点架一挺机枪就可以刷屏。

-WW2的轻武器种类不多，同质化又不是很厉害，兵种的分工比较明显。本作中指挥官的支援能力被加强了不少，如果有个靠谱不浪的电台工具人，不论攻守都能给队友减轻不少压力。武器的结构和动作拆解做的都很好，有断肢，德军真的讲德语，英军的发音也很正，战场氛围营造满分。

-游戏有内购内容，即简介里提到的各国单位=兵模皮肤。单位和武器一样，是否可选要看地图的年份，比如43年以前的地图扮演国防军就没有STG44用。皮肤可以靠提升军阶来获得，或者去社区市场直接购买。高军阶解锁的可能贵点，但DLC包里22块的3款皮在社区市场打包还不到0.5¥，我5块钱买来都觉得血亏。

・キャンペーンモード：勢力拡大の流れとRTSの操作に徐々に慣れていけるレベルデザイン
・コンクエストモード：難易度ノーマルでもびっくりするくらい難しく歯ごたえがある

・マルチ：人がいる。（足を踏み出せないままですが日本人で配信されている方もいる）

＜悪いところ＞
・後発のSwitch版のみ日本語化されておりPC版は公式非対応。
　有志modはあるがPC版の有志日本語化は止まっている。
　（UI・コンクエストまでは日本語化できるがキャンペーンは非対応）
・コミュニティが枯れている：日本語wikiが古いままで攻略指南の通りではうまくいかない

Nioh: Complete Edition,schinese,"[h1]铁打的落命，流水的仁王[/h1]
首先玩过本作的人一定会对“落命”这两个字印象深刻，如果还没玩，或者即将入手，那么你将要深刻的吧这两个字刻在你的游戏时长之上。作为一款硬核ARPG游戏，玩家在游玩仁王的时候，非常容易跪，跪在小兵面前，跪在boss面前，跪在各式各样的陷阱面前。作为一款动作主角，本作的主角“约翰”继承了优良传统，可杀人，可除妖，可把妹，可参政。但比纸还薄的身板，使得玩家频频见到“落命”二字。想当仁王，从落命开始，不是没有道理。而流水的仁王，在你连线之后就可以见到了，几乎满地的红坟，每一个坟就代表了一个王。不得不感叹一句，这王是真的不值钱（错觉，都是错觉，邪念退散！）。

[h1]不一样的战国[/h1]
与暗荣公司出的其他战国游戏不同，这次剑走偏锋。游戏的剧情不再是我们常见的幸村与家康之间的战争，也不是大魔王信长的发家史，而是以一个歪果仁的插入的形式改变了战国式的形状，瞬间从一个正规的历史题材变成了一个斩妖除魔的旅程。遍地都是妖魔横行，作为主角哪能坐视不理，而且就算你不理他，他会不理你？所以咱们就这么开打了，当然在途中少不了美少女们的陪伴。不过这一次美少女们并不是直接作为主角来参与战斗，而是玩家可以幻化为美少女的形象来进行战斗，比如千代啦，阿胜拉（这大长腿）。当然也可以幻化其他形象，需要玩家通关蜘蛛关卡（第六关）才行，形象除了解锁需求之外，也需要大量的武功值（开启线上挖坟模式）。

[h1]硬核ARPG，你可以的[/h1]
游戏虽然是以类魂形式来宣传，但实际玩起来，其实就是标准的ARPG模式。玩家在游戏中有3种不同的攻击模式，每一种模式还有强弱攻击之分，根据使用的武器不同，展现给玩家的效果与动作也不相同。而且在游戏中还有着忍术与阴阳术的设定，这两种比较特殊，释放次数有一定的限制。游戏十分硬核，玩家在初期非常容易落命（后期也容易），尤其是在不实用忍术与阴阳术的情况下，如果不去凹属性，那么等待玩家的将是无尽的“落命”。当然作为ARPG，玩家一旦把属性，装备刷了上去，游戏的难度也就自然而然的随之降低。不过降低的程度也是有一定限制的，所以不要想着属性与装备上去了，就可以开无双了，毕竟这不是无双游戏。

[h1]不俗的画面，但这个BGM怎么回事？[/h1]
我经常说，游戏的画面是一个游戏的脸面，仁王在脸面的制作方面，还是很不错的。破败的村庄，落魄的武士，诡异的鬼魅。从背景到人设，到敌人造型，每一个方面都制作的非常精细。更何况还有美少女的皮肤可换（推荐CE改，真的，刷武功太累），在画面这方面，可挑剔的地方几乎不存在的。但是游戏的BGM却是有些糟心了，主要也指的是从第四个主线任务开始，嗡嗡声不绝于耳，甚至个人都有一种想静音去开音乐的冲动。明明很多地方的BGM都挺不错的，就是这一段BGM直接拉胯，而且在后面场景也有出现，在这种强度的游戏中本身就需要集中精神，这种BGM简直就是来捣乱的。

[h1]没有想象中那么难嘛[/h1]
在个人接手游戏之前，看到评论区高高挂起的差评，心里多少也是有些忐忑的。可实际玩起来之后，并没有他们说的那么难嘛。尤其是被吹上天的立花宗茂，第一次打差点就无伤给过了。至于打法非常简单，等他耗体力呗，谁逼着你去和boss硬刚了？两套连续技吧自己体力耗空，上去一个轻攻一个处决，继续绕柱子，甚至比遇见他之前的雷兽都要好打的多，简直是战国时代的薪王。游戏的玩法并不是上去死磕，我个人也是使用的近战去玩了接近一半的流程，已经打完了雪女，至少到现在也没遇到太难的地方，每一个地方死伤几次，也就过去了。游戏是死的人是活的，一个方法过不去就想另一个方法，没必要死命的说数值如何如何，防御如何如何，过不去，打的难受，也只是方法不对罢了。

总结：非常富有新意的一款ARPG游戏，至于是不是魂类，这要看各个玩家怎么认为。游戏的手感舒适，打击感强烈，玩法多变不拘一格，可以刷刷刷，也可以冲等级拼技术（我打雪女的时候，也就一身黄）。操作也简单，易于上手，如果之前没有玩过类似游戏的话，完全可以一试，玩过类似游戏，那么会更容易上手本作。本作在steam是完全版，也就是包含了之前PS版的所有DLC，即将到来的仁王2也是一样，担心会出DLC圈钱的玩家这次可以放心入手了。

追更一下：现已通关，整体来说与前面所说差别不大。后期boss略有难度，需更小心才可顺利过关（实在不行，召唤寄人嘛）。一周目通关后会直接进入二周目，二周目增加了随机出现的敌人以及敌人的整体实力提升。并且开放了绿色装备（神器），在选择关卡时（二周目）可以选择使用饭碗（忘了叫啥）来提升绿色装备的掉率，也就是说身上的紫装，可以更新换代啦~。而99神也可以通过精华来强化了，可以解锁更多的附加能力（净化本不多，还有宠来抢）。更强的装备，更强的挑战，如果想尝试一下自己的极限或者想看看后面究竟变态到何等地步，绝对可以尝试高难度。但是一周目就过的比较艰难的小伙伴，还是在自己属性加的可以割草的情况下再往后打吧。

11月26追更
通了2周目之后，欢乐感觉更多了，防反和左右闪躲练习成了新的目标。DLC的BOSS真的是给一向偷懒的我上了深刻的一刻，各种秒杀不吃DEBUFF实在是酸爽。技术手感感觉提升了至少一个档次。再去玩原版，嗯。。。感觉那些BOSS都好傻，基本就等同站着挨打（三成哥，我没说你，真的）。除了2周目三成多死了那么几次之外，在通关了DLC的情况下，本篇的2周目BOSS几乎都是一遍过。反而小兵处死了很多次，由此可见小兵奇妙的位置安排是得有夺笋啊。据说5周目小兵与BOSS战都会改变战斗方式，有时间的话，我还会继续下去，感谢大家的点赞啦~·",table tr th Huan Ying Guan Zhu  tr tr th Lai Zhe Li Zhao You Zhi You Xi Kai Hei Ri You Bai Piao uuShi Chang Qia  th tr tr th Jia Su steamShe Qu You Xi Ji De Yong uuE _z th tr table

恶劣内容，手贱勿点。

这款改编从游戏性来说，割草嘛，嘿嘿嘿。
没有太大精力去刷，去弄全成就和全收录。
买下这款游戏是因我对剑锋的热爱，玩通这款游戏是因我对电玩的热爱，不去把它打完满是因这款游戏不值得。

剑锋原本的剧情在这款游戏里毫无体现，纵使基本把能照搬的动画都直接搬上来了。但是这剪辑基本都是主宏观的大场面，且自以为是的剪的七零八碎，而我个人认为剑锋还是要看整套的，细致入微的剧情尤为重要，比如嘎子是如何被出卖以及被菊爆的，这样才能体会到嘎子当初为何如此讨厌别人碰他的心情。
这种剪辑，就像把情色片剪成了了A片，情色片或许带些作者的思想，A片则是满足于阿宅的生理需求。不过话说回来，当你鸡儿梆硬的时候，A片远比情色片更能满足需求。而放在这款割草游戏里，即是替换成暴力。当你只想整点砍砍砍杀杀杀的休闲乐趣的时候，还勉强不错。
更不要提及比较糟糕的即时演算动画了。卡呆看起来是真的呆，僵硬的动作，说不出是痛苦还是惊吓的表情，与其说是失神，倒不如说是丢人，这种造型咿咿呀呀地叫，抱歉我没忍住笑得崩出个带屎星且断断续续无法控制节奏的屁来。
然后就是黑雾马赛克，以及删减。我能理解，为了多捞点钱，总的想办法降低血腥和色情程度不是么，定位和电视台播放的版本差不多吧。

不过话说回来，不管是不是三浦早就构想好的，嘎子长大了，成熟了，我却更中意那个不顾一切一心复仇的嘎子，而现在过多的顾虑。两种样子皆是男人，只不过一个屁股嫩一些，一个屁股紧一些。",Qu Nian Hua Liao Yi Ge Tong Ren Diao Feng Chuan Qi  E Lie Nei Rong Shou Jian Wu Dian  Zhe Kuan Gai Bian Cong You Xi Xing Lai Shuo Ge Cao Ma Mo Mo Mo  Mei You Tai Da Jing Li Qu Shua Qu Nong Quan Cheng Jiu He Quan Shou Lu

BERSERK and the Band of the Hawk,tchinese,"如果有人問我哪部漫畫作品可以完美詮釋現實人生的殘酷與美好，答案絕對是日本漫畫家三浦建太郎所繪製的黑暗奇幻鉅作《烙印勇士》，絕大多數生活不順遂的人們，通常都是在人生洪流掙扎求生的無名小卒，活下去從理所當然的行為變成一種勇氣，儘管早已知道幸福不會慷慨的降臨在自己身上，我們還是選擇積極面對每一天，在物價高漲、貧富不均、法律不公不義、以及缺少關懷和包容的悲慘世界中，努力尋找活在現世的理由。《烙印勇士》男主角格斯就是這一類型的人，不相信神明會帶來奇蹟，經歷背叛的他認為人類不可相信，外表看似不願意投入太多感情在他人身上，隨著冒險旅途中遇見各式各樣的同伴，才讓他開始相信世界仍存在希望，間接道出『活在仇恨並不會得到好處』的人生哲理。

看到《烙印勇士》被改編成無雙類型的動作冒險遊戲，筆者身邊認識這部作品的同好無一人不叫好，為什麼呢？因為《烙印勇士》實在是太適合被改編成無雙遊戲了！原作令人津津樂道的經典場景，其中一幕就是格斯和女主角卡斯嘉墜落懸崖落單，被藍鯨騎士團派出百餘人搜捕，格斯獨自一人斷後要卡斯嘉回到同伴身邊尋求救援，最後不僅成功存活下來，還一人屠戮百人軍隊，被冠上『百人斬格斯』之傳奇稱號。筆者遊玩本作的時間稍晚，剛好是 2017 年 TV 動畫完結的一個禮拜，忍痛看完接近褻瀆原作的 TV 動畫，幸好有這款遊戲療癒心中缺口，同時本作使用大量『黃金時代篇』三部曲劇場版節錄片段在過場動畫，儘管還是有些許限制級片段被刪減，但仍好過品質參差不齊的 TV 動畫，個人十分滿意這樣的安排。


《BERSERK and the Band of the Hawk》可操作角色共有八名，分別是格斯、格里菲斯、捷度、卡思嘉、史爾基、塞爾彼高、左德、華阿爾德，大家看到這裡千萬不要感到失望，畢竟這是《烙印勇士》而非《三國無雙》，擅長打鬥的武將自然沒有很多，加上原著擁有無雙資格的角色幾乎都是反派，光是看到鷹之團時期的格里菲斯、捷度、以及卡思嘉能夠使用就是種驚喜了。撇去擁有超自然力量的小魔女史爾基、不死者左德和黑犬騎士團華阿爾德，塞爾彼高的登場感覺像是硬塞進去的（私心換成骷髏騎士登場），就算以原著戲份來看，塞爾彼高最強大的時期在獸鬼入侵伊諾克村莊跟川馬決戰後，就沒有較為亮眼的表現。

往好的方面看，隨著故事發展，部分角色會逐漸解鎖新的能力，以格斯為例，黃金時期的格斯最多就是揮舞長劍砍砍小兵，偶爾丟些飛刀搗亂敵人，被格里菲斯獻祭給神之手，失去右眼與左手的格斯在鐵匠高特協助下，取得足以斬殺巨龍的『斬龍劍』，左手的機械義肢連著十字弓和隱藏式大砲，腰包內還裝著小型炸彈。當劇情進展到遇見老魔女芙蘿拉時，更可以穿上『狂戰士鎧甲』，斬殺敵人累積狂亂計量表，進入狂亂模式按下變身按鈕，即可進入狂戰士模式，踏著如同鬼魅般的步伐，運用比怪物還像怪物的戰鬥方式，消滅擋在眼前的所有生物。順帶一提，不死者左德和華阿爾德也能變身成使徒模式喔！


關卡設計方面，全部共收錄四十六章的劇情戰役，單一關卡流程說長不長，說短也不短，有些關卡快則五分鐘，最慢十分鐘內就可以結束，除非玩家故意不去完成任務，執著在砍殺敵人上，一般來說順著提示執行任務目標，通常不會有卡關情況發生。值得讚許的是，關卡內的任務相關提示簡單明瞭，打倒特定頭目、護送指定目標、時限內消滅足夠敵人、前往某處觸發劇情等，都會在螢幕右上方小地圖標示地點，通關過程不拖泥帶水，隨著超高速的戰鬥節奏，相信多數玩家跟筆者一樣，耗費十五小時破完主線劇情仍然意猶未竟，接下來就要介紹破關之後消磨時間的好去處，『自由模式』與『無限蝕模式』。

『自由模式』顧名思義就是玩家可選擇喜歡的人物遊玩原先系統限制出場角色的戰役關卡，舉例來說，假設有個關卡限定玩家必須使用格斯才能進行，在自由模式下，我們可以選擇任一可操作角色參戰，看是要操縱格里菲斯前往伊諾克村莊擊殺獸鬼，還是要讓小魔女史爾基回到黃金時代參與米德蘭王國和尤達帝國的百年戰爭，全都沒問題。『無限蝕模式』類似《惡魔獵人》系列的血宮模式，不過融入了任務系統，玩家會進入永無止盡的戰役，完成當前階層的指定任務後，會出現傳送門將你傳送到下一關，通常以五層為一大關，如果你耐心十足突破一百層挑戰，更可以獲得格斯專用的【暗之獸】服裝。


無雙類遊戲總是給人一種無腦殺敵，內容空洞到破關就想封片的刻板印象，《BERSERK and the Band of the Hawk》雖然沒有擺脫此一現象，但它確實達到一個目的，讓《烙印勇士》系列老粉絲能得到一定程度的滿足，同時也讓沒有閱讀過漫畫的玩家開始對原著產生興趣，或許是礙於遊戲分級制度，不少原著內的限制級場景沒有在遊戲內完整還原，部分死忠粉絲很在乎某些劇情沒被完整還原，對筆者來說這些並不直接影響整體遊戲性，想要體驗完整劇情的話，去看漫畫就足夠了。真要說缺點的話大概就是頭目戰的設計過於失敗，咱們操作格斯在斬殺雜兵時可以明顯感受到【砍中東西】的手感，不過在對上有霸體效果的頭目，感覺格斯手中的斬龍劍變成一根毫無殺傷力的木棒，頭目血量確實有持續下降，但那毫無反饋感的打擊感，無疑是澆熄玩家內心熱情的一盆冷水。

如果你不排斥無雙類型遊戲，同時又是《烙印勇士》愛好者，那麼不用等待優惠折扣，《BERSERK and the Band of the Hawk》確實是款值得以原價購買的佳作（至少可以確定遊戲製作人有讀過原著）。假設你對《烙印勇士》沒有任何興趣，只是想找無雙類型遊戲來紓解壓力，那麼筆者建議你選擇登場人物更多、戰役關卡更豐富、武打特效更酷炫的《三國無雙》系列，畢竟動漫改編遊戲主要鎖定的玩家族群都是系列作粉絲，若是要把本作當作是入坑作的玩家，建議先看過『黃金時代篇』三部曲劇場版再由完本作，感觸一定會比較深刻，也能更加容易融入劇情，接下來讓我們一起等待三浦老師有朝一日能畫到結局吧！


優點：
+ 戰鬥節奏快速，關卡設計單純，不太會有卡關情況發生，對新手十分友善。
+ 角色會隨著劇情發展解鎖新型態，例如格斯會從鷹之團傭兵成長成狂戰士。
+ 劇情戰役長達四十六章，全破後還有自由模式和無限蝕模式等著你來挑戰。
+ 收錄長達兩小時黃金時代劇場版過場動畫，攻略劇情同時也看完動畫電影。


缺點：
- 角色培育系統不夠齊全，單靠等級、飾品、戰馬三種要素決定角色強度。
- 骷髏騎士無法成為可操作角色，光榮你搞甚麼？弄成DLC賣我也買單啊！


結論：能感受到製作團隊盡可能還原原著劇情，整體表現算是不錯的佳作。

BERSERK and the Band of the Hawk,schinese,"[h1] 因为挺重要所以直接放在最前面说，游戏自带卡顿，需要在一开始游戏时打开配置工具进行一个设置，就是把Environment 调成 Low，其他全部开最高都没关系，唯独这Environment ，直接关系到是否能60帧爽玩，这个沙雕BUG从游戏登陆PC到现在都没修复（2018.6.18），服了，而且也不用期待中文了，真是可笑，我竟然会对光荣抱有期待[/h1]

前期狂吃剧场版的资源，穿插大量动画过场，质量很高，很堇张，很刺激，玩起来还是很满足，很幸福，感觉量大管饱，黄金时代完了就开始出事了。。吃光了动画以后以后剧情体验感下滑，变回建模人物对话，没有动画资源可以用了（其实。。TV版画风也不对剧场版的画风，真加了也会有人不乐意的），剧情也不好多加什么原创的进去充实一下后面的剧情叙事，流水账平铺再带着疯狂删减一路赶完迷之结局（还是得怪三浦。。吗？心里咯噔一下，这进度再更两年都不够拿来出续作啊。。

不过就我个人玩起来我是真的狂推前期流程，一直在想着这黄金时代有够长的，前期嘎子的剑也没意思，我要赶紧被NTR完拿斩龙剑啊，果然拿到以后也没有让人失望，整个的巨剑厚重感，打击感，招式的凶猛程度直线飞升，这时的游戏才能叫BERSERK啊（而且身上多了很多凶猛的道具可以用。）

然后可用人物不多没关系。人物没特色才是最要命的，（其实也不一定，但是感觉其他人都做得很一般，要不是前摇太长，要不是花拳绣腿，就只有用心做嘎子），不过无双嘛，还是得看开的。主要还是看我巨剑教宗格斯屠戮魑魅魍魉奸邪魔妖，情怀到了，怎么骗我都认。

音乐很对味，配合着流程割起来很爽。游戏里面的听腻了，再开个播放器放TV版的OST接着爽，其实游戏里面的BGM很足，质量也很高，在鉴赏模式里也能感受到，但是实际游戏中运用得很单调，有点迷，有几首特牛逼的曲某一段出现一次就消失了不用了，这么猛的吗，结果就是你在游戏中就听到重复的四五首一看鉴赏模式里好听的曲那么多呢，嗦不出话。

打着汉化推吧，我现在玩着汉化挺好没什么毛病，而且如果是有看过原作的朋友，对话按着原作来就算看不懂也能看出来就是了，台词这部分倒是按着原作来还原的，算是一个 优点

顺带等着今年三浦老师的年更。

往后玩怨念会越来越重，不可描述部分也很健康绿色的完美略过，纯粹是化身成和格斯一样的猛男了，脑子里只有杀，任务多样性？系统耐玩度？敌人种类？剧情名场面还原？不存在的。

再往后玩了玩无限蚀的部分，刷100层不能中途退出，对于时间不充裕的人（也包括本人），玩起来很是恶心，电费与精神双重折磨，耐玩度不是这么堆来的啊。此恨绵绵无绝期，就为了一个无限狂战士形态嘎子，刷特么的，剩下还有几个人也要刷呢，朋友，全成就吗，想要魔化格里菲斯吗？虽然这么不要脸的刷法一直都是无双类很喜欢这么坑你游戏时间的手段就是了

[h1]新增感想 ：[/h1]其实刷100层是有中途的检查点的，比如打到第21层算一个检查点，之后重开可以选择在这几个检查点直接开始，游戏里可以查看就不多说了，还是有希望打完100层的。而且遇到那种藏在角落的中BOSS打了刷出来的饰品很不错，比故事模式中掉的要好很多，其实在主线从蚀之刻开始，难度就开始飙升了（就个人在困难难度的体验来说），如果在流程中感到有些乏力，不妨去刷点好的饰品增强自己，如果是想打造适合自己角色属性的饰品也有相应的系统去提供给你，转移/删除饰品上的属性，还挺不错的，例如我玩嘎子需要的属性就是偏向怒气槽的积攒速度和爆发形态后的持续时间和增伤

100层已经拿下，最后一关就算没有血了满地图跑等怒气，怒气满了再回去硬拼，怒气状态可以无敌硬吃伤害换血，但是格里菲斯伤害真的是巨高，，还很赖皮的甩飞行道具砸你，一套连招下不来地，我一直攒着4个道具栏的满药硬是打到  “真‘一滴血 ”的时候跑图攒了三波怒气去换才极限通关。。有截图为证，慌得不行，差点翻了，不过打通100层以后，哈哈哈哈哈哈哈啊哈哈哈拿到了狂战士格斯，无敌了

[h1] 新增感想：	[/h1]
随着越往后玩，我发现之前对这个游戏会趋于无聊的想法是错误的，虽然终究会厌倦，但是在后期，在嘎子获得了狂战士铠甲以后，本应该是会厌烦的流程竟然是重新大放异彩，体验曲线在下降的时候突然一个急升，推无限蚀模式的压力也小了很多，真正进入到了“爽”这个阶段，剧情上，除了对极其拖节奏的多线刻画的剧情和一些事情的前因还有登场人物的删减以外，其实对主线剧情的大部分补充都放在了事件这一块部分当中，虽然只是对话，但是也是把原作的大部分的主线中起润色作用的叙述给放了进来，感觉就是除了主角以外的人物刻画弱化,但还是有交代一些很关键的的事

不过残念的是断罪大主教的天使护卫删掉变成了几个护卫（虽然预感到如果有。会很难。）格里菲斯去组新鹰之团的那部分也没做，因为做了就要再做一个格里菲斯的魔化后的角色哈哈哈哈（漫画里也没有格里菲斯魔化后完全实力的描写，不好做啊），如果能有新鹰之团里面的那几个怪物可以操作就好了，人马弓箭手帅爆，当然，游戏里并没有

要灵活运用冲刺取消动作的特性来玩操作

《闪乱神乐：少女们的抉择》是Marvelous Games早在2015年便于PS4和PSV上发售的美少女格斗游戏，她既不是系列的首部作品，也不是最后一部，却最具有里程碑意义。游戏首次将少女、忍者、爆衣、抽奖、换装、格斗、割草等诸多大受阿宅们欢迎的游戏要素融合到一起，加上对于女性角色近乎于苛刻的精雕细作，最终将这部游戏精品，呈现在玩家面前。时至今日，本作在很多方面，依然有着难以超越的特色，同时也使其成为Marvelous Games最引以为豪的招牌之一。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023769199
说起忍者，大概给ACG界冲击最大、同时也是烙印最深的作品，大概便是岸本齐史老师的《火影忍者》系列了。有道是：“木叶所过之处，火亦生生不息。”作为三大热血漫画“死火海”中的“火”，《火影忍者》不知道点燃了多少少年热血沸腾的梦想与青春。也是由于火影的超强发挥，使得后来在忍者题材上下功夫的作品，无论是动漫、影视，或者是游戏、小说，都是极大的挑战。毕竟前辈已经有这么一个顶梁大哥站在前面，后起之秀如果不能绽放出足够耀眼的光辉，只能是迅速被时间埋没。

然而就是在这样的大背景下，一个叫做高木谦一郎的家伙，勇敢地为Marvelous Games挑起了忍者题材游戏制作的大任。虽然高木老师现在已经离开了制作组另谋出路，但是从结果来看，当年由他操刀的《闪乱神乐》，确实在火影系列大红大紫的身影下，敢于推陈出新，开辟出了一条了不起的新道路。而这个系列，一做下来居然就坚持了十多年，不仅表现突出，而且还对发行商来说，成为了一棵财源滚滚的摇钱树。那么这款游戏的制胜秘诀在哪里呢？

[h1] 多重满足阿宅梦想，传奇的殿堂级佳作 [/h1]
这件事，大概得先从高木老师本人说起。在成为正经游戏制作人之前，其实高木自己就是一个资深宅男。他不仅热爱动漫、游戏，而且据说还有一间专属于自己的小屋，专门收藏一些羞羞的手办和漫画。身为资深宅男的高木老师，当然就非常明白阿宅们最喜欢的是什么。当他肩负起开发《闪乱神乐》系列后，非常精准地把许多近年来大受阿宅们欢迎的要素融入了这款游戏里。可以说，表面上《闪乱神乐》只是一款和少女风结合的忍者游戏，可是里面的要素之多，可不是简简单单就能够用“少女”、“忍者”这两个词就可以概括的。

先从剧情上说，这款游戏的故事真的普通到有些俗套。整个系列讲述的就是来自不同忍者学院的少女忍者们，为了各自的信仰与理念，互相争斗的故事。而本作《闪乱神乐：少女们的抉择》则在原作的剧情上，将无厘头精神进一步升级。本作的故事发生在“神乐千年祭”的一座海岛上，而曾经那些阵亡的忍者，也基于某些神秘力量，可以暂时苏醒过来。而这股神秘力量，将三大学院的妹子们，全都召唤到这座岛上，为己方阵营而战。故而，一场囊括了曾经牺牲角色，以及现有角色，甚至还有追加角色的忍者大乱斗，就此展开。

单看剧情，真的可以说是平凡无奇；但是要是仔细推敲一下设定，那值得关注的点就很有意思了。正是出于这样的游戏背景，使得本作的登场角色不是一般地多。而且在游戏推出后，制作组还不间断地维持了数年的更新。这些更新，合情又合理地将大量颜值升天的新美女和新时装扩充到游戏里，真可谓是琳琅满目，让人眼花缭乱。即便是初始版本，相比于前作就追加了三名巫女角色。高木真的不是一般地懂宅男的心，性感、可爱、高贵、诱惑的巫女服，简直是所有绅士的美梦。新角色颜值超高，性格也讨巧，真是美哉。

额外需要特别说明的是，高木在女角色的设计水准上，绝对是大师级别的境界。也许是过于丰富的宅男经验，他真的太懂女角色怎么设计能让人喜欢。《闪乱神乐：少女们的抉择》用销量证明了，她所吸引的，可不简简单单是中日韩的玩家。整个亚洲、乃至整个世界的绅士老爷们，对这款作品，都有着极高的共识：绝对是一等一的佳作。那么女角色怎样更加讨人喜欢，性格是重要的一方面，颜值也是不可或缺的一方面。然而，高木却非常实际地抓住了两个点，那就是：妹子萌的奈子！

这款游戏早在发售之初，就曝出了大量奈子设计的新闻和花絮。高木和他的设计团队，对于奈子的用心程度，可以说没有任何别的制作组能够企及。他们为了让游戏中所有人物的乳摇，能够达到最令人满意的程度，夜以继日不辞辛苦地尝试了各种材料，从注满水的气球，到刚出炉的布丁，只为了让奈子在游戏中，一眼看上去就能带给人最真实、最诱人的效果。从结果来说，非常成功。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023769713
本作中那些妹子们的奈子，可不是简简单单用“大”或者“圆”就能概括的。那弹性、那嫩滑、那冲击力，阿伟大型乱葬岗有木有？自从玩了这游戏，我整个人都有点不好了。以后要是别人再问我：“少年啊，你修习忍术是为了追求什么？力量吗，精神吗，梦想吗？”我只会轻轻挑一挑眉毛：“呵呵哒，这些答案是多么的渺小，多么的稚嫩，多么的无知！”我的答案从此只有那伟岸的一个——“奈子”！

[h1] 妹子奈子还有抽奖，忍术割草以及更多 [/h1]
可是，如果只是漂亮的妹子、奈子，加上酷炫的打斗、忍术，明显是不够吸引人的。高木在决心动手前，一定做了大量的市场调研。仔细分析这款《闪乱神乐：少女们的抉择》中的各种细节，不难发现，游戏大量地使用了近年来大受阿宅们幻影的多种游戏要素：人设上，是声音甜、高颜值、大奶子、性格萌的一个个妹子；游戏上，是忍术格斗、无双割草、商店抽卡、海量换装的多要素内容。以上的提到的要素，无论是哪一个，都是最近几年深受玩家们喜爱和欢迎的。

在游戏主界面，玩家可以轻松自由地调整游戏的各项参数和特色。本作的优化很好，即便是在4K屏下开全高画质，依然运行很流畅。但是与之相对应的，画面却很细腻精致，无论是中低画质，还是顶尖画质，在显示屏上的演出效果就比较出色。玩家可以在主界面轻松地选择喜爱的角色，进行主线或者支线任务。有一部分角色和支线任务，需要购买DLC解锁，喜欢的真爱党玩家，可以根据需求量力而行。个人建议是，优先解锁自己喜欢的人物，再去考虑DLC的支线。毕竟游戏并不以剧情见长，主线故事基本上就能满足大多数人需求了。

游戏的操作方面，这款游戏优先推荐使用手柄，体验会远远高于键盘。按键很简单，左摇杆走位，右摇杆视角，A键跳跃，而XYB三键通过技能组合，能打出许多独特的攻击连招。玩家拥有一行体力与一行“忍气”。当成功攻击、或者是受到伤害时，“忍气”条都会增长。当处于临界值时，就可以按动Y键，爆发出范围大、伤害高的必杀技能。也许是为了进一步提升无双割草的畅快感受，本作的“忍气”条上涨很快，战斗中可以轻松地频繁打出必杀技能，无论是视觉效果还是游戏体验，都更加畅快淋漓。

游戏中，还有一个特别有趣的设定，每个角色，除去最基本的形态以外，都还能按住RT或者LT进行“忍转身”和“命驱”的变身。这两套变身系统，都可以说是福利中的福利，变身时妹子的衣服都会瞬间脱光，“忍转身”会瞬间从身体某个部位，掏出一支卷轴，然后变身换上忍者制服（巫女服真是太诱人了！）在瞬间血量回满的基础上，获得一套新的技能及能力。而“命驱”状态下，妹子会变成只剩内衣的状态，血量和防御力会减少，但是速度和攻击会增加。该怎么选择，请大家自行斟酌，不过单纯是喜欢看妹子脱衣服的绅士老爷，请忽略以前面说的话。

[h1] 综合评价 [/h1]
总的来说，《闪乱神乐：少女们的抉择》可以概括成为一款美少女格斗游戏，但是内涵却又不仅仅局限于此。由于融入了大量深受绅士老爷们喜爱的要素，使得本作更加像是一款出色的“第一人称射（你们懂的）击游戏”。这款游戏，在大量同类型游戏的映衬下，显得格外引人瞩目，是难以超越的一部佳作。

[b][h1]前言[/h1][/b]
　　SENRAN KAGURA ESTIVAL VERSUS，中文译名为-------闪乱神乐：少女们的选择，简称为闪乱神乐EV。改作由[url=http://www.tamsoft.co.jp/]Tamsoft[/url]开发，并由[url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/xseedgames]Marvelous[/url]发行，是一款动作冒险类ACT游戏。主线剧情承接为[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/411830/SENRAN_KAGURA_SHINOVI_VERSUS/]闪乱神乐：少女们的证明 - SENRAN KAGURA SHINOVI VERSUS
[/url]。游戏玩法主要分为主线剧情、个人支线、特殊忍务、多人对战等多种玩法，[spoiler]其实我个人感觉更衣室环节也算是一种玩法丨小声BB。[/spoiler]单结局，游玩时长较长，是一款相当值得游玩的游戏。

[b][h1]游戏背景[/h1][/b]
　　故事的开始，月闪、半藏、蛇女、焰红莲队的少女们被一道奇异的光芒传送到了一个未知的世界。而就在这里，她们被迫参与到了神乐千年祭，遭遇到了新的队伍-----由巫神乐三姐妹莲华、华毘、华风流所组成的新的势力。她们之间需要展开战斗，互相破坏对方势力的神橹，并在飞鸟的婆婆----前神乐小百合的引导下，一步步探寻这个世界的真相。期间，她们还要面对复活过来的故人们，黑影爷爷、雨姬、雅绯的母亲等等......面对故人重逢的少女们，陷入了战斗意志的迷失中，她们能否认清自我，并寻得世界的真相呢？

[b][h1]游戏特点[/h1][/b]
1️⃣[u][b]众多风格各异的可操作少女[/b][/u]
　　加上DLC中的人物，该作共拥有35名可操作的少女角色。在玩家通关过一周目的主线流程后，玩家可以自由的操作这些少女们去再次游玩之前的剧情，或是游玩少女们的个人小剧场剧情。或清纯、或妖娆、或知性、或狂野，总有一款少女是你想要的。并且，在游戏的福利社环节，玩家还可以通过抽签来解锁更多服装，购买福利CG以及人物发型，人物语音包等等。除此之外，玩家可以在更衣室内自由的装扮心仪的角色。不多说，在下先舔为敬。

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1852694505
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1853030221 

2️⃣[u][b]优秀而又搞笑的剧情[/b][/u]
　　主线故事主要讲述了少女们在神乐千年祭中所发生的故事，其间不乏一些幽默诙谐的日常。或为相见亲人时的感动，或为少女们相[spoiler]（sang）[/spoiler]亲[spoiler](xin)[/spoiler]相[spoiler]（bing）[/spoiler]爱[spoiler]（kuang）[/spoiler]的打闹，或为冲破迷茫的果决，抑或是坚定向前的意志。闪乱神乐：少女们的选择为玩家很好的诠释了什么叫做一部优秀的作品。在游玩主线完毕后，玩家还可以在百花缭乱纪中游玩少女们各自独立的支线剧情，通关后解锁该角色的CV配音以及福利CG。

3️⃣[u][b]豪华的CV阵容[/b][/u]
　　显然，闪乱神乐的开发商除了懂得“你给我柰子，我给你钱”的人生哲理以外，还深谙CV阵容的重要性。喜多村英梨、井上喜久子、原由实.......众多知名的声优仿佛不要钱似的往里砸。有软有萌，有硬有御，喜欢日系声线配音的玩家，相信这部作品一定可以满足你的口味。

[b][h1]存在问题[/h1][/b]
1️⃣[u][b]联机鬼服[/b][/u]
　　实际上，改作是支持玩家通过网络连接对战的。无奈游戏已经发售了一段时间，再加上热衷于此类游戏网络对战的玩家相对来说不是那么的多，因而很难找到可以一起对战的玩家。因而，有联机意向的玩家可以通过好友间开黑或者steam群组等多种方法来寻求其他玩家一起游玩。

2️⃣[u][b]角色实力/出场的不平衡[/b][/u]
　　说实话，每种少女都拥有各自独立的战斗武器与战斗风格，这本来是一件好事。然而，部分角色之间的差异有点过于明显。不谈远程角色如华风流一类的伤害极低，单单近战角色，如夜樱、美野里等角色，先不说由于人气的原因出场非常少，印象中夜樱在整个主线剧情中的操作次数似乎只有寥寥三次而已，单单她们的攻击范围极小，技能打击面也极小，极易造成‘空大’现象，因而在实际上手操作中，对比某些强力角色--------四季、飞鸟、日影等人，明显可以感受到差距。再加上玩家首次攻略主线时，只能按照系统所规定的角色进行任务，而如果玩家操作或者角色等级不高，便很难完成关卡。

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1852694332  

3️⃣[u][b]人物动作僵直时间过长[/b][/u]
　　如果以一个PVE或者说PVP对战游戏来讲，改作人物动作的僵直未免有点过于的长。不谈冲刺动作结束后存在一秒左右的僵直，单单玩家在普通攻击连击结束、技能释放结束后仍然存在着约为1秒钟的空挡。当玩家真正上手操作时，便可以体会到这短短1秒钟所带来的粘滞感和不流畅的感觉。实际上，这也是我对该游戏成见最大的一点。虽然距发售已经过去了很久，但还是希望厂商能够修复这一点。

[b][h1]总结[/h1][/b]
　　尽管闪乱神乐EV是有着一定的瑕疵的，然而面对这些柰子、屁股、大白腿，[spoiler]又有谁可以说出“我拒绝”这样的话呢？[/spoiler]

[b][h1]推荐人群[/h1][/b]
　　柰子玩家、萌豚爱好者、无双游戏爱好者。

SENRAN KAGURA ESTIVAL VERSUS,schinese,这款游戏并不只有奶子和割草，它是一款设计用心的动作格斗游戏。游戏的精髓都在联机部分上面，游戏中许多隐藏的要素和机制是不能通过剧情模式来了解的，只能通过玩家在联机中不断的尝试来发现。虽然单机是款割草无双的游戏，但这在联机中并不能适用，对战讲究攻防结合，防御意识在游戏中尤其重要，同时还要通过大量的时间来增长对战经验。至于不少玩家觉得闪乱SV比EV的硬直小、割草更爽快，那是因为EV的大硬直是为联机作铺垫的，硬直大的招式会让你在打出该招式时更为谨慎，因为这往往会暴露自己的破绽给对方，抓对方硬直作为突破口也是一种不错的战术，所以出招前要充分考虑是否应当使用该招式和其利弊。白天忍道场的房间很少，一般都是在晚上10点左右开始有路人房间，对于新手建议先把剧情过一遍，熟悉下各种人物角色后再去玩联机。毕竟联机部分是款动作格斗游戏，那么竞技性就会比较强，自然就会有输赢，最好保持良好的心态，打不过对方也不要气馁，就当作是一次对战经验的增长，再通过更多的练习来提高自己（我有着被大佬捶几百个小时经历XD）。如果有喜欢联机的玩家，可以加我好友，我也可以教学一下怎么玩这款游戏，同时也有个专门的EV联机Q群（146839801），可以和群里的萌新或大佬互相提高，有时还会组织一下小队战。最后祝愿大家能在联机中找到更多的乐趣~,

在经过了几十个小时的游戏后，我不得不怀着遗憾的心情将这个评价改为不推荐。
目前游戏不知道是什么原因有着各样姿势的跳出bug，前几天还好都是第一次进游戏，进入忍务的时候跳出，后来全程畅玩，直到我这两天做特殊任务，各种跳出bug简直扑面而来。
而且更加恶劣的是，特殊忍务最后一关只要我开始进去就必定跳出，这玩个奶子呀？哦，不对，我本来就是在玩奶子。
除了这些姿势繁多的跳出bug，还有一点很让人残念的是读取速度很成问题。我不清楚这是不是我个人个例，但是就普通任务我平均读取速度是10秒，某些特殊忍务的读取速度设置高达30秒，不是很理解这到底是什么原理，我觉得我的850pro是假的，是不存在的。
希望制作组能好好修复一下这些bug，太糟心了。

Railway Empire,schinese,在这款游戏里，你可以用这些轰鸣的钢铁巨兽和铁轨连接不同的城市和乡村，收购不同的领地和工厂等来丰富自己公司的产业结构，使自己的公司不只有铁路。我比较喜欢采用的策略是买债券，买股票还有并购自己竞争对手这样商业层面的事，甚至有一次买了很多债券后直接将自己的竞争对手并购，再一点点挣钱还债。等把所有的城市并入自己的铁路网后，你就真的建立了一个“铁路帝国”。因为这款游戏的背景与美国历史有关，我知道太平洋铁路是美国历史上比较著名的一段铁路，横跨了北美洲，所以你还可以或多或少感受一下铁路在美国历史中发挥的作用。我叫这款游戏小文明，但整体给人感觉是很休闲的，不像文明系列那样每次停不下来。,

Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force,schinese,"170小时，5周目全成就毕业，简要说一下重点：
1.传统的日系RPG剧情，流程不算长但也中规中矩；
2.角色立绘很棒，无论是主角还是妖圣；
3.一些成就稍微肝一些；
4.如果是从原版过来的，这作的难度要稍大一些，DLC们（deluxe pack除外）可以降低一些肝度和难度。觉得自己的肝够大的可以不用买DLC，如果只是休闲玩，DLC还是推荐入手；
5.战斗时可以使用离队队友好评，喜欢谁就能用谁；
6.时间越往后，打折幅度越大，忍住了的话全DLC入手能更便宜。
如果你喜欢这种画风而且又喜欢传统的日式RPG，推荐打折的时候全DLC入手。

Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force,schinese,"在某论坛狗管理的评测诱惑下steam首发买的，买的时候dlc都没出，结果当天上午出了一堆强力dlc，搞得我只能退款重买大包，然后又因为退款需要接近一天的时间错过了大包的临时工价格，不过这些都无所谓了，反正那段时间都没玩，最近才捡起来玩的。
    　　游戏信息：目前游戏时间35小时（5小时挂卡时间），一周目normal难度，dlc只差最后的电子设定集dlc，没看剧情攻略，完成了女神线的提亚娜结局（我连结局的分支在哪儿都不知道），完成时全员中等级最低的为48级，最高的53级。下面我就以我个人的感受来说一下这个游戏（尽量不剧透）
  

     　　1，游戏自带繁体中文，在steam库里面右键游戏，点击属性，选择语言可以调。

     　　2,本作是回合制RPG，遇到怪后会触发攻击画面，而且有行动顺序先后，所以不想每次都让怪兽先手你就让行动的队长（就是你走地图时的角色）学习警戒这一能力。打你果然，由于该游戏的每个角色都有走迷宫的有奖任务，所以可以考虑全员学习警戒，记住迷宫（地图）内无法存档，请小心行事

     　　3，steam版游戏建议用xbox one的手柄玩，因为鼠标键盘的操作相当之反人类，用xbox one手柄玩记得A是攻击和确认，B是跳跃和返回以及跳过剧情，而游戏里面的介绍是相反的，不知道怎么回事。
      
    　　 4，官方dlc非常强力，如果想轻松愉快的刷怪看剧情可以选择购买，唯一的遗憾是两个官方dlc提供的武器/防具只有4套，而游戏内你要控制6个人，当然强力妖圣（可以理解为一种特殊道具，因为主要作用是提供各种属性加成）有6个

    　　 5，游戏内由于剧情原因和支线系统的设置，有几个地图都要跑4遍，如果不想刷怪，要善用游戏的冲刺功能（LT键），直奔剧情点

      　　6，游戏内有一个决定剧情走向的拔剑和插剑系统（我这么叫的），拔出的剑相当于一种buff，在你要去迷宫前插在附近，解锁游戏剧情和提供各种加成（如掉落率，经验，金钱等加成），其中，我认为有两把比较重要，一把是1.5倍wp加成附带双倍伤害的剑（插在女神身上），另一把是禁用魔法的剑（插在魔神身上）。wp点相当于技能点，是解锁每个角色的各种必杀技，魔法等各种能力所需要的，而wp点光靠打怪的话太慢。而双倍伤害是你对别人造成的伤害和别人对你造成的伤害都翻倍，记得是双向关系。这把剑后期要慎用，在有双倍伤害的情况下，后期的怪可能会一招就把你你战斗人员秒了。举个例子，我后期打帝金龙的时候（全dlc，满级妖圣），它先手攻击（设定如此）一个大型魔法就直接秒杀我方4人，然后就没法打了，所以后期插这把剑要慎重。至于禁用魔法这把剑，如果你和我一样是平砍菜刀流的话，打起来会很舒畅，因为包括帝金龙在内的很多后期boss的毁灭性大招都是魔法，它们的普攻反而很弱，不过禁用魔法后，我方的奶妈据没法放恢复魔法了，只能嗑药，所以请自行判断。

    　　 7，游戏人物的普通攻击拥有连段系统（一次攻击能砍几下），除第一段外每一段有3个攻击选项，建议全员先升级到3连攻击，第四连段后期再说，攻击方式有普通攻击，连续攻击，上挑攻击，其中上挑攻击可以将敌人击飞，然后连续攻击可以对空中的敌人进行攻击（有额外的伤害加成），所以配置连段攻击可以考虑用第一段普通攻击（只能是这个），第二段设置一个上挑攻击，第三段设置一个连续攻击，最好后两个都设置为A键攻击，就可以很简单的靠按AAA打出一套不小的连招。

    　　8，游戏中有一个支线很容易错过，而这个支线错过了就没有剧情S级妖圣和S级剑，关于这一点可以看别人的攻略，我感觉我个人说不清楚。

    　　9，记得去合成飞翔石，不然最后一个迷宫的跳跃很麻烦

    总体来说，这个游戏还是很值得玩的，而且自带繁中，推荐大家夏促入手

[list]
    [*]雪山中でのSFストーリー
    [*]サブクエストによるストーリー補足
    [*]キャラの個性に応じた役割分担
    [*]各行動に応じたスキルポイント取得
    [*]自然・生物との戦い
[/list]

など例えるならHow to Surviveのお話強めサバイバルRPGという印象。

飛行機落下地点から全員スタートし、お互いに役割分担しながら資材を集め、
資材は施設の強化に使え、[u]シェルフはスキル強化[/u]に[u]作業場は新たな道具製作[/u]につながる

夜は冷えと飢えをしのぐため、シェルフで寝て過ごすか火を起こしてしのぐ。
武器、罠を作り、動物を狩って食料を確保する。
サバイバルをしながら、自分たちがなぜこんな状況に陥ったかの真相を解明していく。そんな感じのゲームです。

[b]バランス[/b]
死んだら成長が最初からになる[u]サバイバー[/u](ノーマル)、リセットされない[u]探検家[/u](イージー)の２つがあり
サバイバルゲームとしてもストーリーを楽しむゲームとしても遊べるようデザインされています。

探検家の場合、強化が完了し物資も充実すると死亡する脅威がほぼなくなるため、
探検家で慣れてから新規ワールドでサバイバーに移行するといいかもしれません。


[b]注意点[/b]
・作業場、シェルフは梱包しないと他の場所で設置できない。
・リスポーンポイントを設定できず、死んだらスタート地点に飛ぶ。
・ストーリーは主に読み物で、ムービー等はないため好みが分かれる。
[u]・クエストポイントに誰かが到達すると全員進行するため、ストーリー目的なら注意。[/u]
・キャラクターがアイテムにひっかかるため、散らかしてると狭い所が通れなくなる場合がある。
・途中参加の場合、他プレイヤーと時間がずれる可能性がある（バグかもしれません）
・落下ダメージがすごく痛い
・崖に落ちると回収できなくなる、復帰できなくなるポイントがある。（マップの黒い所）
・用意されている拠点が、ほったらかしすぎると使用不可能になる（時々戻って日数リセットする必要がある）
・農作などのビルディング要素が薄く、建築系が好きな場合にはあまりむいてない。
・フレンドリーファイアあり。

※今後更新で変わるものもあると思います。

早期アクセスゆえ、タイムアウトしやすかったり、クエストが進行できなくなるなどのバグも散見されるが、

これからもどんどん発展していくゲームだと思いますが、ストーリーはまだまだ序盤という感じなので、お話を一気に見たい場合は正式リリース後のほうが楽しめるかも？

Bomber Crew,japanese,"史上最大の戦争 第二次世界大戦をＲＡＦ（英国空軍）は不屈の闘志で戦い抜きました。そして今、ＲＡＦの爆撃機乗りであるあなたたちの前には一機のランカスター爆撃機が鎮座しています。司令官は言いました。
「これに乗ってヨーロッパ爆撃してきて。お前ら不屈だし楽勝っしょ♪」
嫌です。単機で敵中深く侵入してメッサーシュミットとステゴロしながら精密爆撃キメろってあなた正気ですか。とはいえ離隊したいなら二階級特進するしかありません。とんだブラック基地に配属された不運を呪いながらあなたは今日も出撃するのでした。

このゲームは敵弾を華麗に避けながら敵機や地上物を片っ端から破壊するゲームではありません。クルーに指示して敵の攻撃をしのぎながら目標への爆撃を成功させて（可能なら）生還するゲームです。

あなたの前に立ちふさがるのは迎撃機の群れと対空砲の弾幕。弾を食らえばエンジンは火を吹きタンクからは燃料が漏れクルーは負傷して放置すれば死に至ります。引き込み脚を対空砲に吹っ飛ばされて胴体着陸なんて日常茶飯事。被弾しなくても電装系や油圧系が故障すればレーダーや銃座は沈黙し、燃料タンクが空になれば当然墜落します。高度を上げたら現在位置をロストし帰還するつもりがドイツの中心部へ一直線に飛んでいたなんてケースも。
あなたにできる事は出撃の合間に機体とクルーを強化すること。そして一旦出撃したらクルーに指示を下すことです。
装甲を強化し強力なエンジンに換装すればより多くの被弾に耐えられます。機銃を増設すれば敵機を撃墜できる可能性が高くなります。信頼性の高い部品は故障率をほぼゼロにしてくれます。ヘルメットや防弾ジャケットはクルーのダメージを抑え、酸素ボンベと防寒服を着用すれば高高度で耐えられる時間が長くなります。ライフジャケットは不時着した時の生存率を高めてくれます。
一旦離陸したらクルーに指示する事はてんこ盛り。土壇場でブーストするために機関士に燃料を節約させましょう。通信士に基地と交信させて危険地帯を知り、回避するためのルートを航法士に提示させましょう。高度を上げて対空砲を避けターゲットが雲に隠れて見えないなら地上すれすれまで降下するのはパイロットの役目。対空砲に狙われたら機体を蛇行させて回避し戦闘機に食いつかれたら急降下で振り切れる可能性に賭けましょう。使用する弾薬やスキルを機銃手に指示すると迎撃が容易になります。爆撃手が爆弾を落とすタイミングはあなた次第なので標的の真上を通過する瞬間に投弾しましょう。
そして必要なら故障個所を修理したり瀕死の仲間を救うためにクルーを向かわせましょう。とはいえクルーの数は普通に飛ばすだけでぎりぎりです。誰を向かわせるのか、その間空いた穴をどうするのか。とっさの判断が生死を分けます。
武運つたなく墜落すると機体は失われますが、クルーについては一人ごとに生存判定が行われ成功すれば生還できます。資金のストックがあればなんとかなる機体と違ってベテランクルーの穴は補充兵を育成する事でしか埋められません。帰還が不可能と判断したら不時着を試みたりパラシュートで脱出するのも一つの手です。
ミッションはフリーミッションと重要ミッションがあり、重要ミッションをクリアするたびに終戦が近づきます。重要ミッションは史実の作戦がモデルで反跳爆弾と聞いてピンと来るような人間ならツボる事必至。

コミカルでかいがいしくて蛍のように死んでしまうクルーを勝利の日まで一人でも多く生き残らせてやりましょう。",Shi Shang Zui Da noZhan Zheng

以最新的史低价格，我非常推荐这款游戏。
如果你频繁卡死的话请切换成无边窗口化模式，全屏切桌面QQ什么的，极易5分钟内卡死。
我切换无边化玩了20小时也没卡死过，而且流畅无比，没有任何传说中的卡顿优化差什么的。

这作同屏僵尸数量剧增，简直堆满了画面，打击感也很强。
比起之前那种纯粹胡来的NPC支线任务和无厘头的滑稽道具，有一定程度上的收敛，更加符合逻辑性，更加真实。
简单模式不搞全收集一周目也要15小时左右，结果还是个假结局，要DLC玩复苏的弗兰克才能真正完美通关。
难度模式形同虚设，根本不可能一周目直接噩梦难度，必须靠多周目通关后积累技能和数值才能畅玩噩梦难度。
DLC复苏的3个结局也是如此，一周目跑全收集再通关简直是不可能完成的任务。虽然变相拖戏延长游戏时间，但是仍然处于我理解和承受的范围之内。本来就是收集物品砍杀僵尸的游戏，反复刷一刷总比没了任务一脸懵逼的要强很多，至少再周目还有目的性值得探索。
游戏玩法非常多，剧情，高尔夫，卡普空英雄，DLC复苏的弗兰克、联网模式额外图纸，等等等等，每个都够你反复玩好几次。
我觉得流程模式一点都不短，甚至还很长，再看一眼100多个成就，更是增加了重玩激励。
游戏繁体中文可以选港台配音，也可以只要繁体字幕配合英文配音，这设置就很良心。
这作的NPC还是一如既往的低AI，NPC都特别丑，尤其是你要顺路救的野生NPC，不但丑，说话重复性还极强，每个人只有一句固定语音，到另一个城市你救的还是长相和语音一模一样的人。避难所也看不出丝毫区别。但是这些都只是临时驿站，真正的战场很大很丰富饱满，大量可以进入的建筑，大量等待收集的物品，有人讨厌这作的先找钥匙后开锁的图纸获取方式，我觉得这点很妙。
如果像是以往那样很容易获得图纸或者组合道具，那么玩家直接登天游戏节奏就更会崩坏。这种循序渐进的过程增进了目的性，而且并不盲目，可以在避难所用金币购买地图，解锁一切能收集到的物品，我发自真心的认为这是改良，而不是退化。
4代新增的改进元素实在是多，后面的我就都简单说一句吧。
随身随地组合道具。存档不用找厕所，几乎半自动存档。
没有时间限制的救人、找药这种烦死的任务。
强化机械外骨骼，能拿起巨型物品或者组合成更强力的机甲，超酷又超爽。
超深度的卡普空自家联动，不只是情怀，趣味性，更增添了无厘头和扩展性，可能性，真的妙。非常有趣的融合，虽然可能很多人不玩单独的卡普空英雄模式，但是比比皆是的卡普空元素在剧情中实属锦上添花。
加入了成吨的圣诞元素，就像是一个全新的合成派系，欢庆的节日气氛非常契合丧尸围城游戏定位。
每个模式都有独特的技能，即便可能是很短暂的尝鲜，但是也能看出开发组为多样性做出了大量的努力。
我非常期待丧尸围城5，丧尸文化起源于卡普空，自然更加期待卡普空继续发扬光大。未来一定会有续作或者这种搞笑僵尸风格的割草新游戏，丧尸围城1234至此我全部多周目通关了，特别满足。
感谢每个被我暴虐的肉逼僵尸，只有你们慢吞吞的样子才是我心目中真正的僵尸该有的可爱模样。
我不敢玩恐怖游戏，但是丧尸围城给了我机会，陪伴我度过了一个血腥而又美好的青春。

复苏的弗兰克DLC把之前切镜头重置的零碎小挑战、饱受诟病的限时任务等等全部从主线剧情中分割开来，既不失经典，又使DLC玩法独特，符合DLC剧情的急促感。尤其主线剧情最后直升机那段画面实在经典，剧情编排巧妙，我真的为导演拍案叫绝。

Dead Rising 4,schinese,实在可惜，工作室关闭了，说实话虽然有人仅仅因为结局就差评，但我却从丧尸围城4中获取了不少乐趣，画质也很好，缺点就是不能联机剧情，还甚至一直期待着丧尸围城5的消息，现在看来只能期待其它游戏了🙃至于如此之多的差评，理由是不够诚恳完美结局需要宁外购买才能玩到...而我觉得游戏本体才是结局，那个dlc其实是扩展的额外游戏以致于大家心目中的“完美结局”。,

１，２，ＯＴＲ，３クリア済み。
総評：クソゲー。俺のデッドラを返してくれ・・・

悪いところ：（あまりにひどくて推敲する気力も無くて箇条書き）
・ジャーナリストのフランクさん、カメラの楽しさを殺された。撮影はオマケ未満と化し、ストーリーを進めるための苦痛作業に組み込まれた。お！？と思って撮影してもポイントゼロ。SteamのSS機能しか使わなくなる。
・ホラーゲームにはおっぱい担当が必要だろうが！！セクシー系が消えた。武具の大人のおもちゃすらない。女性キャラの造形もひどい。魅力皆無。カメラ撮影にもセクシーポイント加算が無い。
・上記をもっと言えば生存者（救助した人たち）の見分けがつかないほど。ってか、ランダム自動生成じゃなかろうか・・・セーフハウスにバグで人がモリモリ増えるときがあるんだけど、服装も顔も違う人が同じ位置に重なって生成されてる。
・散策中に自動発生するイベントがひどい。百歩譲ってランダム内容がランダム位置で発生は新鮮味を与えるために頑張ったのかもしれない。が、ストーリー上、まだ入れない位置に発生して生存者を助けろとか言われてもストレスしかたまらない。なんで発生ポイントを今行ける位置だけに絞らなかったのかと問い詰めたい。
・生存者との共闘が無くなった。助けた瞬間にセーフハウスに移動したことになる。画面上にはその生存者が残っていても。目の前でその生存者が視界から消えるまでずいぶんかかる上に死ぬこともある。が、セーフハウスに移動したことになってる。そして前述どおり記憶に残らないNPCだけに助けたのがドレかわからない。
・マップの作りがひどい。前作までは「え？こんなところにゾンブレックスが？」とか、バリケードで頑張ってたのかぁ、やるなぁ。とか。トイレからショートカット！？こいつぁ使えるぜ。とか、ないない。苦痛だけ。
・任意セーブが無くなった。トイレに駆け込む楽しみが無い。トイレの存在意義が無い。セーブして終わらせたくなったらマップの切り替え位置みたいな特定位置まで移動しての自動セーブを発生させるしかない。トイレを覚えるほうが楽なのに無駄に移動させられる。

バグもとにかく酷いです。終了時に必ず不正終了だの、持ってる武具がいつのまにかなくなってるだのは当たり前。ゾンビも自分も壁にハマってクリア不能だの、キー入力を受け付けなくなってなぶり殺しだの・・・

Dead Rising 4,schinese,"游戏名：丧尸围城4
过了这么久，终于在pc上也迎来了丧尸围城的第四作，在一段时间的游玩后，进度为二周目普通难度通关人物87级，但是二周目过后我就失去了玩的动力，其实我还在玩二周目收集时就想放弃了，我们来分别说说这一作吧，事先表明前3代游戏我都只是有看过视频，所以并没法在剧情上深入说什么，仅仅能表达在这一作看到的些东西。
这一作的武器合成上直接采用了3代的合成系统，武器数量不多，蓝图数量也少，也没有那些特殊的蓝图（3代的黄金蓝图），总共26个近战武器，大概27个远程武器，7个投掷武器，8辆載具（这只是大概数量，懒得打开游戏看了）。因为没有真的去体验每一把武器，所以只能以我接触过的组合武器来说，冰剑和火剑是十分imba的武器，也只有这两把武器能刷的比较起劲，投掷物我基本没怎么用所以不评价，远程武器就钻孔机和兰博箭为比较实在的武器，车辆只有一辆战争贩子是最为实用的。总体来说武器上并没有什么特别之处，而且还觉得比较少。
在游戏操作手感上，其实应该和3代变化不大吧？无双起来的话也还是会很爽快，也会有很多地方会聚集着大量的僵尸让你杀个爽。总的来说没啥特别说的。
拍照方面的话感觉这一作的拍照仅仅是给你拍照的，为什么这么说呢，因为感觉没什么可以拍来加分的彩蛋，从而让拍照这部分显得十分的平淡甚至连拍都不想去拍了。
生还者方面，这一代的生还者的作用是升级周围的庇护所，从而解锁收集各种物品用的地图（解锁完还要购买），如果你发现你逛了几圈那个区域就是不出生还者，那可以到下一个城市救生还者，然后再回去那个区域就会开始刷生还者，营救完生还者也不需要带着他们走，只要任务一完成他们就会自行离开，并且会给你一把武器或者是组合武器。不知道是不是难度原因，生还者基本不会死。然后就是还有一种敌对生还者，那个势力称为暗卫军，一般会在一些固定点生成，然后会在生成的地方原地防御，如果被他们发现他们会基本不顾一切的优先攻击你，一般会有一些拿枪的，一直扫射你消耗你的血量，算是比较烦人的吧。在生还者上做的还是非常简单的，没有啥挑战性实在是很遗憾
支线任务上的话就有刚才提到的营救生还者，破坏暗卫军设备，抢夺补给箱，这些都是常刷在区域上的小型支线。稍微大点的支线是消灭恶徒和调查谣言，可以说是前几代的疯子boss吧？没有特别的出场动画，攻击也只是先刷几波兵给你打然后本尊跳下来和你打，很容易就能把他们弄死，给的奖励也不多，也没能带给玩家多大的印象和冲击感。总的来说这方面表现挺差的，而且这种支线任务还很少，我记得大概只有不到十个这样的任务吧。
技能方面，这一代舍弃了以往的一格一格的血量计算，直接使用的一条的数据计算，食物补充的血量好像也是固定的。技能上就加加血量上限，加加体力上限，给各种武器增加能暴击的能力，增加pp收入或者连击时间之类简单的技能，到最后一列技能部分需要获得技能书才能习得，其中4本可以直接在5级避难所买来，然后就是要看运气或者真的有耐心一家一家店仔细找了。总的来说技能方面很普通不出彩，而且还有些烦人的收集。
收集方面，这一代的收集要素，没什么特别需要收集的地方，因为如果你真的要收集的话，那可要废好一把心机，就算买了地图，也会很打脸的告诉你各种奇怪的地方有很多收集品，如果真的下定决心要收集，听我劝一句，涂鸦喷漆这个收集元素，不是你真的非常非常非常收集强迫症，都还是顺路收集收集，因为喷漆涂鸦就只是个收集元素，不像手机和报纸和维克的上传资料一样有一定内容在里面。
这一代有着一套动力装甲系统，其实我觉得嘛，实用性不如正常模式好，只是方便脱离寸步难走的僵尸堆方便而已，然后各种动力装甲的强化装置就像黑科技一样诱惑着你用。一些主线和boss战在后期也强迫你用动力装甲，还有些蓝图要用动力装甲才能获得。动力装甲也有专门给他用的装备，但是穿了动力装甲后就不能上載具，上了就自动解除，所以不是很方便使用，不适合刷僵尸，适合处理比较多的特殊僵尸的时候。
对了，这一作如果你想凭自己意识去打boss不准时走流程，分分钟出bug。还有时互动太多很容易出bug，比如无法挥武器和互动的bug（主要bug），合成两件装备按太快容易崩游戏，不能进行快跑（也是主要bug）
主线故事与boss战我只能稍微瞎扯扯，没深入了解前面几代的剧情。（以下内容包含比较多的剧透）
[spoiler] 这一代的剧情真心不算好，很多地方都是强行弄出一点蜿蜒曲折的感觉。这里容我小吐槽一下，开始无论你潜行杀不杀那个士兵，后面的剧情都会说弗兰克因为在军事基地杀了一个手无寸铁的佣兵被通缉，然后就一年后，弗兰克躲在小乡村教课，又被zdf还是zod（记不住那个僵尸防御组织叫啥了）的部长吧还是谁找到，然后又带到了威拉姆特然后过来的直升机还炸了，然后不断探索出真相是忘了叫啥博士搞出的这次瘟疫，而且还搞出个身穿动力装甲的最终boss，最后强行回到了购物中心打死了最终boss在逃离到最后一步一堆僵尸抓住了弗兰克，弗兰克决定牺牲自己让直升机起飞，然后弗兰克就便当了（才怪呢我看到了机票内容是弗兰克的复苏，吔屎啦卡表）。boss站也十分无聊，总共就差不多5场boss战吧，而且boss攻击方式过于单调，甚至还有些boss能被卡地形。。主线也很无聊，到处跑跑腿调查调查，而且剧情和平庸。（维克这个傲娇强行让剧情蜿蜒曲折）[/spoiler]
评分： 6.5/10  不出彩太过平庸的一作，联机方面没做测试，以上内容均为单机。如果推的稍微快一点估计剧情不到8小时就推完了，剧情缺乏，游戏性缺乏.游戏总体只剩个刷是看头，价格也不一般，就算半价了都得仔细思考才能再决定入不入。机票或许会有些额外的剧情，但是不怀特别多的期待。",spoiler Ping Fen

METAL GEAR SURVIVE,schinese,"[h1]没有灵魂的延续——《合金装备：幸存》评测[/h1]
[url=https://steamcn.com/t368270-1-1] 原贴地址(完整图文)[/url]
[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/255962/]STCN鉴赏家[/url]

[h1]前言[/h1]
就像当年的老iw与使命召唤、三上真司与生化危机一样，在小岛秀夫离开后，《合金装备》的延续再也不会有灵魂，在看完了一系列的预告片后，我非常的好奇，konami用FOX引擎打造出一款没有灵魂的《合金装备》究竟是怎样的，游戏类型从潜入游戏变成了生存游戏，还有预告片中所展现的游戏玩法与内容，怀着这样的好奇心我购买了这款游戏，同时内心十分的复杂。

介于这是一款争议巨大的游戏，我不会从表现力和游戏性方面来讲，而是先介绍一遍游戏的内容然后列出游戏的缺点与优点，（什么？居然有优点？）是的，如果把它当成一款生存游戏，它确实有优点，可如果把它当成一款合金装备的续作，抱歉，那真没什么好说的。


[h1]游戏内容-在异世界打僵尸[/h1]
游戏是发生在原爆点之后，主角通过虫洞进入到了一个异世界里，从此展开一段“从零开始的异世界生活”，konami还特别给出了一个理由，在剧情开头交代了这是一段野史，说明了不会牵扯到正传的剧情，所以剧情即使再怎么天马行空也都是合理的。

游戏的区域大体分为两种，迷雾区与氧气区，迷雾区相当于游戏副本，进入迷雾区需要消耗氧气，会随时间逐渐减少，氧气值降到零时就会大片掉血然后死亡，大多数僵尸和怪物都在迷雾区里，杀死僵尸可以获得班库能量，在游戏里是一种非常重要的东西，可以用来升级与制造。

僵尸的AI非常“弱智”，但伤害很高，被不被发现无所谓，只要你不去撩他，蛇皮走位就能穿过一大片僵尸，而且大部分僵尸不会攀爬，你只要占据了高点就可以戳上一整天，潜行？不存在的。

随着剧情的推进会碰到其他的高级僵尸，有会发射炮弹的僵尸，有类似幻痛里的骷髅兵的奇行种僵尸（会跳会体术），还有一种浑身着火而且不怕子弹的僵尸（沃尔金？）等等，但僵尸的数量占比非常大，除了僵尸还是僵尸，僵尸总共有七种，非僵尸怪物总共有五种，游戏的怪物种类非常少，手指头都能数得过来。

怪物有弱点设定，比如普通僵尸弱点在头，自爆僵尸弱点在下半身，前期装备与等级不足只能尽量绕后暗杀，后期学到技能可以开无双正面刚，还能制作机枪和手榴弹杀死一片，感觉还是挺爽的。


[h1]游戏内容-建设小康社会[/h1]
作为一款生存游戏，在游戏里能看到许多《饥荒》的影子，游戏里有饥饿值与口渴值，会随时间逐渐减少，玩家需要吃食物和喝水来补充，当饥饿值或口渴值降到零时就会掉血然后死亡，而且减少的速度很快，时不时走着走着就饿，走着走着就渴，跟个饿死鬼一样，由于剧情前期物资缺乏，只能喝脏水和捡老鼠吃，温饱方面很有压力，到了后期基地里能种菜能养羊，基本衣食无忧了。

食物会腐烂，需要拿去烹饪来延长保质期，有三种烹饪方式，烧烤、熬汤和烟熏，烹饪出的食物相比未烹饪过的食物加成更高，有些食物还会有BUFF加成（类似怪物猎人的猫饭），熬汤是性价比最高的，可以同时加饥饿与口渴，烟熏则是永不会腐烂，其实烧烤跟熬汤是非常难腐烂的，我放了很长一段时间也没见有腐烂，所以都差不多。

基地是游戏中最重要的地方，制造、升级、烹饪等等都在基地里，需要建造相应的设施才可以使用这些功能，还能种田养羊解决温饱问题，建造帐篷解决成员的住宿问题，建造防御设施来抵御僵尸的进攻等等，可以按自己的想法任意摆放，随着剧情的推进还会开启一个副基地（FOB），但没有建造功能。


[h1]游戏内容-废土垃圾（肾亏）王[/h1]
游戏中除了血量还有体力的设定，饥饿值影响血量的上限，口渴值影响体力的上限，跑步、使用战斗技能都会流失体力，并且流失的速度很快，特别是跑步，跑一小段路就不行了，在迷雾区里流失速度会变得更快，另外在迷雾区里蹲下走路也会流失体力。

玩家如果受到受害或者吃了腐烂的食物和脏水会出现相应的伤病（随机，看人品），沿用了合金装备3的系统，不同的伤病需要不同的药物来治疗，药物也是需要制造的。

游戏里的武器、工具以及基地设施等等都有颜色品质（白、绿、蓝、紫、橙），并且需要找到相应的设计图才可以制造，高级的设计图（紫色及以上）的获取途径可通过参与多人模式、在迷雾区解锁箱子或者击杀强大的怪物来获取，制造需要消耗班库能量以及相应的材料。

制造的材料散布在迷雾区的各个地方，你可以捡一个轮胎、砍一棵树、戳烂一个铁桶，甚至是拆一部电脑，这些都可以把它们转化为需要的材料，材料捡多了会有负重惩罚，轻则不能跑步，重则原地不动（强迫你卸货），有材料的地方过一段时间会重新刷新，材料也分颜色品质，越高级的材料往往在越危险的地方，在迷雾区里可以开启许多的传送装置，之后就可以与基地来回传送，能让你更加高效地捡垃圾


[h1]游戏内容-开局一把矛，装备技能全靠打[/h1]
游戏里的武器分两大类，主要武器与次要武器，主要武器有些复杂，分腰部武器（单手武器、双手武器、枪支）与背部武器（矛、弓、重型武器、枪支），次要武器则都是枪支（手枪与霰弹枪），防具分四个部位（头部、上半身、手套、下半身），武器和防具都是有耐久的，需要修理，另外武器还可以强化，越高级的武器强化的门槛也越高。

工具方面就很杂了，有手雷地雷、望远镜、防御设施（铁护栏、陷阱）等等，防御设施有点意思，你可以在任意地方放置路障或者陷阱（类似堡垒之夜），比如放个铁护栏把僵尸拦住，然后拿长枪一直戳，或者放个自动机枪然后在旁边吃瓜，但相同的套路用多了也会腻。

除此之外还有生存装备，氧气瓶和虫洞回收是必备的，其他生存装置则可以增加负重上限、带更多的武器与工具以及增加某类子弹的携带数量等等，这样看来主角每次出门要带的东西也太多了吧。

玩家升级需要班库能量，每次升级都能获得技能点，用来学习技能，技能有分基础技能与职业技能，玩家通关后通过一个小任务就能解锁职业，有四种（突击、侦查、潜行、医疗），每种职业都有相应的一套职业技能，相比基础技能厉害很多，明显是为多人模式而生的，相当于告诉你单人剧情只是个教程，游戏才真正开始，还有玩家通过解包后发现游戏未来还会推出相应的职业套装（全境封锁？）。


[h1]游戏缺点[/h1]
[h1]1.服务器与存档机制[/h1]
我想把这两个合在一起说，因为这两个搭配在一起简直完美，先说游戏的服务器，游戏需要全程联网，本人裸连游玩，服务器正常的时候没什么问题，一到服务器抽风的时候，你怎样都进不去，要等一段时间恢复好了才能进去，这还没什么，前面说了这游戏需要全程联网，而且服务器还不怎么好，所以是可能会出现中途掉线的，需要重新进游戏，然后是游戏的存档机制，在游戏中你要回到基地才能存档，如果你在外长途跋涉一路捡垃圾杀僵尸，可能顺路还做了几个小支线，然后你做主线不小心失败了或者在外面死了，那不好意思，之前的全都白做了，本人试过几次，回到基地里后一脸懵逼，如果是为了增加难度我无话可说，关键是这游戏是全程联网，随时可能会出现中途断线的情况，真的会让你气到砸外设，本人比较幸运，没有碰到这种情况，掉线都是在基地里，有位贴吧老哥可就没那么幸运了，他做一个主线掉线了八次。

[h1]2.应付式的过场[/h1]
我敢说在单人剧情里，七成是弹窗聊天的过场，主角一个人在外面与基地里的成员沟通，用这种方式呈现出使用通讯设备讲话的情景还没什么，但能经常看到面对面讲话也用这种方式，就这样看着你们几个之间在互相发短信，过场有点敷衍了事的感觉。

[h1]3.多人模式单一重复无配合[/h1]
多人模式里的关卡都是清一色的防守，守护挖掘机抵御一波又一波的僵尸，单一而且重复，玩久了会有腻的感觉，而且都是各打各的，你可以选择到处划水抱大腿，也可以选择清怪刷分拿装备，除了刚进地图或防守胜利后一起做动作跳舞，真看不出哪里有什么团队合作，队伍语音里不是闲聊就是那种廉价耳机发出的噪音。

[h1]4.氪金内容[/h1]
游戏里的氪金味道很浓，没有你看不到，只有你想不到，建多个角色需要氪金、弄多个派遣队需要氪金等等，除此之外还能买VIP通行证，另外游戏里每天都会送游戏币，差不多上线一个月就能攒够钱开第二个角色了，有些人可能会觉得（还不错啊，每天会送钱，才一个月而已），其实已经不知不觉陷入了konami所制造的满足当中，不过好的地方是氪金内容不会影响到基本的游戏体验，不氪金也能玩。

[h1]5.边角料[/h1]
游戏的单人剧情地点会从荒漠（阿富汗）转移到雨林（安哥拉），有种似曾相识的感觉，如果你玩过幻痛，一路上你能看到许许多多熟悉的地方，比如幻痛里阿富汗的村落、安哥拉的废弃船只、老头的别墅等等，大多数只是在原有的基础上稍加修饰，加上浓浓的迷雾，显得荒凉与阴森，但毫无新意可言，走多了会感觉很无聊，如果把该死的迷雾弄开，估计眼前的景象能把我震惊。[/size]

[h1]6.强行增加难度[/h1]
游戏的最近几次更新更改了多人模式里的掉落，比如原本能拿一两个紫箱，现在只能拿到蓝箱，很明显是在强行增加难度，拖慢玩家的游戏节奏，另外游戏里的车与步行机甲开久了会爆炸，不是没油而是爆炸，还有进入其他氧气区，氧气值却不会增加（大哥你吸多几口会死吗），一定要回基地才能补充，这些设定匪夷所思，感觉是为难而难。


[h1]游戏优点[/h1]
[h1]1.剧情有点意思[/h1]
剧情前期平淡无奇，到了后期才开始变得有点意思，有二五仔，有萨赫勒猿人，还有时间悖论的设定，僵尸与迷雾的秘密也会被揭开，前面看不懂的地方原来都是为后面做铺垫，另外游戏有两个结局，其中一个是隐藏的，有趣的是游戏会把这个隐藏结局的开启方法直接放到你的面前，但不会告诉你，而是吸引好奇的你来上钩。

[h1]2.紧张与绝望[/h1]
由于游戏里奇葩的存档机制，在迷雾区中探索会变得小心谨慎，还要时不时注意自己的氧气、饥饿与口渴，特别是杀了一堆僵尸后拿了不少的班库能量和身上带着满满的垃圾，你会非常害怕自己会死，因为只要一死就全都白忙活了，在迷雾区中探索久了，我会有一种熟悉的感觉，对，就是玩黑魂的那种感觉，那种身上负担满满，前方充满未知，但一心只想见到篝火的那种感觉，还要特别感谢游戏的服务器，加上中途随时可能会有掉线的情况，会让你的冒险更加紧张刺激（呵呵）。

在迷雾区里，地图上是不会显示玩家的方位的，如果到了没去过的地方还不能使用定位导航，需要返回基地存档，下次再回到同样的地方才能使用，所以前期非常容易迷路，特别是路痴，因为迷雾区里的许多地方都是没去过的，只会越走越远，越陷越深，会让你感到非常绝望，不过到了后期就没有这种感觉了。

[h1]3.恐怖的氛围[/h1]
虽然边角料挺多，但有些室内场景还是做的挺阴森的，孤人一身而且又很安静，只能听到附近有僵尸的声音，有几次没注意躺在拐角的僵尸，一经过就把它吵醒了，把我吓了一跳，恐怖的氛围还是不错的。

第一次见到大BOSS让我挺吃惊的，本来迷雾区就又暗又多怪，而且还是孤身一人，现在又突然出现一只这么大的怪物，真的是消受不起，所以每次见到它我都会与它保持距离。


[h1]总结与购买建议[/h1]
[h1]总结[/h1]
作为一款多人合作在线生存游戏，里面能看到许多其他游戏的影子，饥饿口渴以及氧气的设定透露出了浓浓的生存味道，基地建造以及装备与职业系统让游戏变的耐玩，元素五花八门但显得臃肿，多人模式节奏很快并且容易上手，但关卡玩法单一，玩久了会有重复工作的感觉，而作为外传性质的剧情，虽然剧情天马行空，但其内容还是有亮点可寻，也不失硬核与挑战，游戏能挖掘与提升的空间还很大，未必不能成为一款耐玩并且爽快的游戏，前提是konami能把游戏好好的做下去。

[h1]购买建议[/h1]
游戏由FOX引擎打造，优化还是可以的，玩起来流畅不掉帧，而且自带繁体中文，游戏虽然用的是幻痛的素材，但跟幻痛完全不是一个类型的游戏，这是一款生存游戏，不过这不是重点，重点是如果你看完后还对这款游戏感兴趣的话，可以买来玩一玩，由于Steam锁国区，只能推荐去GMG或Yuplay买带折扣的Key。

[h1]小尾巴[/h1]
我不知道konami对小岛的遗产还要榨取多久，也不知道《合金装备：幸存》之后还会不会有下一部《合金装备》作品，但我觉得这个系列真的需要完结了，失去灵魂的身体只会是一具行尸走肉，也许幸存把「合金装备」的名字摘下能变得更好，但不管怎样，有些东西它再也不会回来了，就让那位叼着雪茄的独眼大叔好好地成为我们的美好回忆吧。",Yuan Tie Di Zhi Wan Zheng Tu Wen url

METAL GEAR SURVIVE,schinese,"这游戏就这样吧，前后期弱智成这样的游戏我是第一次见。只有中期还能算得上比较不错的。

刚开始这个游戏疯狂给你教学，就怕你什么也不知道，然后开始了求生之旅，没水没吃的能力还低，你这种菜鸡还能进MSF，活该Mother Base被XOF gank。不过玩家都死了一次了，还在床上躺了几个月，菜就菜吧。

后面这游戏有意思了，打出了辐射4生存模式的味道，而且比辐射4简单多了，起码你不用天天嗑抗辐宁，听义勇军黑叔叔的话去通马桶。武器种类也多起来了，起码不像前期你只能放个栏杆，拿个破棍子到处捅。主线过完后还有两个后置任务，完成了能解锁副职业，四个副职业对于玩家来说如同进化一样，又有了不同的体验。

但是，从这之后，这个游戏就变成了极其非常弱智的刷刷刷游戏。
缺材料？刷！
缺能量升级？刷！
缺图纸造东西？刷TM的！
前两个我还能接受，不说全境封锁从1.0大使馆里刷M14，我也是MGSV里把重新开始键按烂的人。
但是后面缺图纸这个是极度不友好的。这游戏有两种图纸获取方法，一个是单人模式里找箱子开，另一种就是挖掘机去挖。挖掘机挖也是有两种方法，一个是通关在家挖，另一个是coop里去挖。

先说coop挖掘，coop挖掘也就是beta版里的防守任务，一共就5张图，图少就少吧，图多了我还不知道从哪儿扒资源。但是难度和获得不成正比，easy和normal难度，虽然你拿不上图纸，不过给你的资源也算多，还能单刷。
但是到了hard难度，不仅难度提升，而且流程又臭又长，需要的能量也因为最近的更新变多了，通关送你的资源都不够你耗的，蓝图极少，我和我朋友打了三天只出了几种变种子弹的蓝图。

“那行，我在家自己挖怎么样？”
在家挖掘你可以用自己基地造的防御单位来守护挖掘机，你还能用存在保险箱里的装备，掏出几十个手雷扔出个未来。
但是当你打完一波攻击后，挖掘机需要重启，重启时间不像你玩coop那种就几分钟的事，你得等12个小时。
不要嫌长，还有24小时的。
如果4点钟你打开了挖掘任务，守完后等待重启，24小时还好，12小时我凌晨4点起来就为了守基地？虽然能让NPC帮你守，但是这游戏救援NPC任务少的可怜，你家里的NPC不是让你找货柜就是让你找货柜，根本力不从心。
怎么办？
氪金啊！
氪金瞬间重启，免去一切等待烦恼。

Base building mechanics are okay, but the real fun is running around in the Dust (a la the Dark Zone in the Division) and trying not to get killed while you gather up materials.

Co-op is pretty dead, but the single player campaign lasts around 25 hours.

METAL GEAR SURVIVE,japanese,"大体20時間位やった上での感想です。
一応定価で買って値段なりには楽しんでいます。
MGSVは未プレイです。
今のところ後悔はないです。

ゲーム性については他の方々が述べていらっしゃるので、気になった点を挙げていきたいと思います。
とにもかくにもゲーム序盤は飢えと渇きに悩ませられます。
ただただひたすらに走り回って小動物を見つけることに苦心させられました。

それらリソースの供給が安定する中盤以降は武器のレシピ回収やマップ埋めをコツコツやっていく感覚が個人的には楽しめました。
ただひたすら同じに景色なので、新鮮さが中盤以降失われていくのが少し惜しいです。

マルチでプレイするとハクスラ的に様々な効果がついた武器や、各種素材が通常プレーよりはるかに効率よく集まります。
なので自分的にはマルチを楽しむと言うよりかは、素材を集めると言うような感覚でプレイしていました。

総じると、半額位で買うなら間違いなくオススメです。
定価で買っても…まぁオッケーです。

Toukiden 2,schinese,"《讨鬼传2》是一款半开放世界的共斗游戏，为什么说是半开放世界呢，游戏虽然说自己是开放世界，但是整个地图基本只有一条路相通，从A想去C，就必须要到B再到C，这并不开放啊。且战斗会生成战斗区域，接到村子任务也是出现在指定位置进行战斗，因此说它是开放世界并不够。
讨鬼2拥有大量可选择的武器种类，每种武器又有多种组合的魂，同时游戏最多支持四人在线联机。
2代最大的改变是新增了许多技能以及钩爪的使用，使得战斗变得更加多样化，也让战斗变得更加紧凑快节奏了。
本作的优化提升明显，动作流畅不再慢动作，节奏明显比前作加快了很多。
半开放世界的模式见仁见智，地图很大，不再有1代区域的划分，然而后期支线任务传送跑图距离远，时间长确实一大诟病。
2代战斗的节奏更快，策略性更强，新增了魂武技和钩爪，钩爪的作用相当大，对移动战斗破坏都有很大的提升，让战斗过程变得更爽快，进入大型鬼战斗后，战斗区域限制一个圈内，部分场景狭窄，影响游戏体验。
前台接任务线下与线上的存档不通用，其实这个跟前作是一样的，线下打完一套上级装备去打线上，会容易太多。
DLC内容仅包含线上的任务，村子里接任务后不需要跑图直接传送到战斗区域开始战斗。
剧情方面较前作有所提升，每个人物都有自己的剧情，加上讨鬼的独特世界观，剧情辗转且饱满，但还是感觉存在感薄弱，毕竟战斗才是重点。
部分前作可选队友来到2代依然可选，加上新增的队友，可选择队友非常多，坦克、输出、治疗，各种组合满足各种需求。怪物种类比前作多了不少，但是玩到后期还是会看到各种熟悉的身影，各种前面怪物的加强版。因为讨鬼传系列没有战斗道具，战斗只有武器和各种技能，加上这代的快节奏，外加半开放世界的怪物乱入，总体来说战斗还是非常爽快的。",
Toukiden 2,schinese,类似游戏有很多，干嘛要浪费时间在半成品味道浓厚的讨鬼二代上……,
Toukiden 2,schinese,"讨鬼三作玩了这个和1  1代那残念的部位破坏和移动方式在鬼手加入后有了极大改善  依然记得一代面对常夜拿着把太刀死活破不干净的绝望 讨鬼2也终于算自成一派 有了特色 绝不比ge差

至于真猎人玩讨鬼只是个嘲讽盗版的老段子而且当时的讨鬼1作为试水作确实相当不完善
讨鬼2即使称不上神作 也算是个合格的共斗游戏  还拿老眼光针对 那可能也只是个跟风的睿智了",Jue Bu Bi geChai Ye Suan Shi Ge He Ge De Gong Dou You Xi  Huan Na Lao Yan Guang Zhen Dui  Na Ke Neng Ye Zhi Shi Ge Gen Feng De Rui Zhi Liao

Toukiden 2,schinese,"8/10，足够优秀的开放世界狩猎游戏。
35小时上下的主线剧情，稍微有点套路式的展开并不阻碍带给玩家的感动。剧情上的弱点大概就是后期对于打大怪→封门这个进展模式的解释略显牵强。
狩猎任务部分格局稍微有点小，并不像MH系列会有转区等等多样化的要素，所谓“开放世界”反而成为了狩猎场景的桎梏，但是小场景的优点是可以加快战斗的节奏。鬼手的设计可以看出基本也是让狩猎节奏变得更快。
音乐和声优都是加分项，可以说是百听不腻的那种。场景方面也没有突兀而扎眼的设计，地图也有很好的指引性，不过感觉跳界石设计的有些少了，假如有更多的话，可以省去很多跑图时间。啊，非常值得一提的一点是：游戏的过场动画做的非常好。
多人部分暂时还没有玩，其他评测里说的“键盘键位太奇怪”也的确是存在的。不过玩到现在基本没有发现Bug，质量还是比较有保证的。
作为原价预购党觉得这个游戏很值，之后应该会全成就，补一补DLC什么的。",

给它打好评的人到底是慕专八之名吹而来，还是怎么回事？
真的有好好摸遍地图，把文本都看一看吗？

无论是游戏中任何一个系统，都不如无冬之夜2

就是神界2都比不过

设定、音乐、画风非常糟糕，特别是文案上有股很臭恶的old school的nerd死宅味，
既不黑色幽默，也不震撼人，刻画更不深刻，无意义的设定细节堆砌罢了

其中很多设定不要说和现在的设定比，比近代的光明王也没有好到哪里去，
编剧自己把自己写高潮了，

像是DC电影一样，翻来覆去讲什么世界既不黑也不白而是灰一样，
什么都大而化之，人物性格毫无弧光，处处都是胡乱展开

当年辐射新维加斯的时候，树状支线形散而神凝，为刻画世界观和引向主线高潮而服务，

Steel Division: Normandy 44,japanese,"「ヒトラーの手下どもはみんな死んじまったよ。見ろあの砲弾孔。あんな穴ボコまみれで生きてる奴なんかいやしないさ。」～『貧乏籤』(イギリス・1973年)

第二次世界大戦末期の西部前線を舞台に、外国人義勇兵を満載した寄せ集めドイツ軍と、いつもの米・英連邦軍に、自由フランスと自由ポーランドの戦士たちが加わったリアルアベンジャーズが繰り広げる泥沼戦争RTS。
前線の押し合いをテーマにしたRTSで、コンクエスト――いわゆる陣取り合戦ではWargameのようなセクターや、CoHやMoWのStrategic point(戦略ポイント)ではなく、指揮統制のとれた部隊の配置によって優劣が決まるユニークなシステムを採用しています。
逆に言えば、指揮ユニットさえあればとりあえず前線を形成している体はなせるので、別の場所で兵力を集中したり、逆に非指揮ユニットを浸透させて敵前線の背後で破壊活動を行えます。陰湿だ。

本作の見どころは、戦闘が長期化するにつれてより強力な兵器・部隊が投入されるフェーズシステムです。序盤の小競り合いから全面戦争へと発展していく様は実際西部戦線。
二次大戦末期特有の中古兵器の使いまわしや鹵獲改造兵器がやたら出てくるのも高ポイント。モデルグラフィックスの読者投稿欄めいたEugenの逆張りミリオタぢからに震えよう。

RUSEほどカジュアルではないけど、Wargameほどハードでもない二次大戦RTS。有志の日本語化MODがあるので操作等で悩むことは無いでしょう。アンロック要素とかもないし、気になったらセールの時とかに買うといいと思います。DLCはそれぞれに長ったらしいレビューがあるのでそちらを参照してください。解散！",

Steel Division: Normandy 44,schinese,"《钢铁之师：诺曼底44》从名字上可以看出来，本作集中于44年的诺曼底。
游戏是EUGEN开发，P社发行的，继承了《战争游戏：红龙》的引擎和特色玩法，可以看做红龙的精神续作——二战版的战争游戏系列。

作为续作引擎的确是得到了不少提升，首先房屋不再是永久性坚固了，在钢铁之师里，房屋都可以被摧毁掉。其次，对操作也进行了一定的优化，红龙中4个单位一班组，在这里变成了独立单位，取消了不太实用的班组设定，增加了视野界面，能够很好的观察单位视野和射程。并且加入了自动组卡，让新手也能够很好的上手熟悉游戏，战役变成了之前的关卡式，取消了红龙中失败而无聊的大地图战略式战役。

然而本作能感受到这只是一个试水作，也存在很大的赶工。首先的年代固定，注定比不上战争游戏中那么庞大的武器库，然后地点战役也固定了，注定了只能西线和特定的军队。所以本作虽说保留了最具有特色的组卡系统，但是只能用固定的师去组卡，并且单位明显少很多，但是限制了多样性，也少了很多乐趣，感觉这也是一个为后续DLC能添加更多的师做准备的吧。

打了很多次10v10，果然这个游戏的另一个特色就是10v10体验壮观的大战感觉。玩了后发现，本作的确是二战，而不是现代战争。装甲突击，火炮掩护，步兵战线推进，这都是非常具有二战特色的，如果认为这和红龙差不多那么您就大错特错了。（怀念红龙中的mi25机降...）游戏还是很还原二战，考验的是战术策略以及灵活运用兵种相克，慢手速也能玩的很好，是一款二战迷必备的游戏。

再说下这个游戏的硬伤，首先服务器不稳定是一个很大的的问题，国内如果不用加速器的话大概率会掉线。其次，平衡性值得商量，目前的版本中纳粹德国真的过于强大，导致现在选国家都是一边倒，能解决这两个问题，感觉这游戏就很不错了。

对于未来的展望，希望后续作品能有东线，能有更多年代的武器，能扩展到北非战场太平洋等等。意大利，日本，甚至民国就好了。

由于极度糟糕的平衡性，已经到了无法玩的地步了，德军胜率几乎90%的感觉，虎豹一路无双A，萌军无空优无好AT无解！游戏已经接近鬼服。平衡性这东西始终是一个软指标，如果改了这个游戏还是很不错的。到时候再改好评吧（可惜人气已经没了，都回滚 战争游戏红龙了）
不推荐

==========
2017年9月24日
经过了几次大更新后，游戏平衡性也渐渐地能够玩下去了，所以改成了推荐。虽然中国大陆服务器问题一直存在延迟掉线困扰，不挂加速器无法联机玩的地步，但是不可否认，这是一款非常出色的二战游戏，也是目前较为真实的二战游戏。现在也玩了近100小时了，每个师都有自己的特色，只能自己去适应每个师，而不是要用步兵师去玩坦克流那是作死。关于德国虎王太强的说法，其实德国拥有虎王也是后期了，如果盟军一开始不能保持RUSH优势，那么后期的确没法混。如果前期保持了优势，后期且战且退基本上可以稳赢。对付虎王有很多方法，个人常用的就是烟雾弹，让虎王影响视线发挥不了优势。丛林地方埋伏反坦克兵，飞机火炮也可以掩护打虎王士气，一步步狙击（仅个人方法）

游戏是一个非常好的游戏，尤其是还有很多后续的DLC更新，现在我觉得作为二战迷和喜欢真实RTS环境的玩家可以入手啦！（当然最好是等打折，P社节操嘛233）",Bu Tui Jian

NBA 2K18,tchinese,這一代的切入終於不再頻頻撞牆，不必原地雜耍也能作為強大的武器了。,
NBA 2K18,schinese,"虽然2K20都要出了，但2K18的差评是一定要安排的。

这代的年货NBA 2K相较于之前，主要就动作方面细节多了一些。我最关心的也是我认为每代最应加强的AI可以说没变，完全照搬2K17，蠢得喷血……。MC模式（名人堂），得分后卫，你运个球队友一堆人跟着你跑，全站一起，全场失误有尼玛一半是队友撞掉的？？？没氪金开始能力值还低，战术也叫不动。至于对手反正就还是老一套，无脑颜射。队友防守也不管，就是离3分线一大步，放别人12345号位随便射，来一摆烂队都打得你冒烟，最后一看对手3分命中，60%，嚯……。打完半场教练还嘲讽你一句，对手某某命中率太高，那我管得着？

赛季后期，场均50分，依然还是没个单打战术，队友依然还是跟着我跑，防守也放。想赢只能对轰，对手拿40，我拿50这样。而且队友还不能拿球，拿球超过3秒，大概率就会自信的射了。到总决赛打勇士，达到了对轰的极致，最后自己拿下100分才艰难取胜……。

至于MC这个模式也磨人，载入需要联网本来就慢，进去了还必须得锻炼两次，训练三次，中间又是载入，全套弄完15分钟，结果打一场球快的也就只要半小时，哈哈……。

最后说到能力值，这代是真的肝。从2K16的6分钟一节，一个赛季打满基本毕业，到2K18的12分钟一节，打满两个赛季才基本毕业？？？所以说，以后NBA 2K系列的标准版，应该叫穷鬼版，那是拿给你这些穷鬼肝的，想要体验常规流程，您高贵的Gold版请。",Zhe Dai De Nian Huo nba

簡單評論
這一代只玩MG模式
簡單來說第一年多了個劇情
第二年開始就跟之前一樣沒有任何變化
應付球員要求/老闆要求/面對該死的媒體/還有那群反骨的工作人員/跟其他貪婪的GM交易
如果金幣夠多.倒是可以考慮購買球隊.可以不用面對該死老闆的不合理要求
遊戲內容大同小異.畢竟籃球規則內容就這些.很難有新的東西產生出來
比賽有些BUG.但不太影響比賽
(這一代的金幣竟然變便宜了)

NBA 2K18,schinese,"[h1]致江湖最后一个大佬[/h1]

没有来得及见过凌晨四点的洛杉矶，却听到了凌晨四点传来的噩耗。

不同于艾弗森、加内特这种底层出身的球星，需要有一堆穷哥们儿要养，也不喜欢嘻哈风，更热衷于深色袜子、西装笔挺的参加脱口秀，也不同于卡特、希尔这种中产出身的球星，面对激烈的竞争他无法做到心平气和，进而顺势转型，因为他总是永不言败。更不同于库里和哈登这种新时代的球星，按照数据优化自己的打法和出手选择，他更喜欢单挑、中距离、低位单打。

“朋友来来去去，但总冠军旗帜永远飘扬。”
“总有人是要赢的，为什么不能是我呢。”

科比，是一个独特的人，是NBA的分水岭，是旧时代最后的荣光，是江湖的最后一个大佬。

既是江湖最后一个大佬，总有自己的派头和排面，虽然时代变得让他有点格格不入，但他总有底线，他会倔强、顽固地坚守自己的底线，这又怎能不让人喟然长叹？

就像最后一个赛季，他可以在整个常规赛划水，频繁在微笑中露出八颗牙、给每个后辈签名、告诉他们“你百分百像我”。但在最后一战，他抛开之前的温柔敦厚，要什么温情，要什么追忆，要什么热泪盈眶，要什么高风亮节，就是要透支体力打出巅峰状态，就是要浑身颤抖着拿下60分，就是要以一个胜利者的姿态走出球馆。

这合理吗？这不合理！但这很科比。

就像今天，科比离开这个世界的方式一样。

这合理吗？这不合理！这太不合理了！​​​​

至此，

始于凌晨四点，也止于凌晨四点。

Assassin's Creed Origins,schinese,"[h1]Assassin's Creed® Origins —— 刺客信条：起源[/h1]
杀队长、找宝箱、杀队长找宝箱

+风景优美、幅员辽阔
（旅游模拟器，让玩家认识到一个除了沙漠、金字塔、狮身人面像之外，充满生机的埃及大地。“埃及的诅咒”DLC中更是大胆想象，呈现了与埃及神话传说对应的死后世界的样貌，搭配海量的武器服装和相机模式，喜欢的玩家一定大呼过瘾）
+武器种类多样，美术设计优秀
（多样的远程和近战武器增加了战斗系统的丰富度，包括服装坐骑和制作升级在内的所有物品设计华美又恰到好处不过分夸张，让人有收集欲）
+细节考究、寓教于乐
（游戏本体中就可以看出细节丰富贴合时代，而导览模式更是系统地介绍了古埃及、古希腊和古罗马的方方面面，制作人员或是引经据典，或是合理想象还原，为我们呈现了一个栩栩如生的埃及世界）

-平庸的剧情、敷衍的支线
（本体+无形者+埃及的诅咒，除了无形者的几段剧情，大部分主线剧情都无法带给我惊喜或是情感上的波动，敷衍的支线剧情以及糟糕的节奏控制让本就平淡如水的主线更增添几分失忆功效）

[b]如果给起源的美术打10分，那游戏玩法最多拿4分[/b]

地图做得很大，但没有能力添加足量的高质量内容，只能反复堆砌平庸无聊的地图问号，杀队长、找宝箱、杀队长找宝箱，你没法说这些内容是完全复制粘贴的，场景不同、布局不同、敌人构成不同，但在玩法匮乏的情况下，一切好像又没什么不同，前往目标，完成目标，前往下一个目标，玩家就是没有感情的清问号机器。RPG的等级设定则和这些问号“相辅相成”，等级的提升没有改变实质的战斗方式（除了遥控掠食者弓），单纯是数值上的“我变强了”，原本RPG的成长性变成了锁住玩家进度的桎梏，想专心主线的人会被卡等级不得不做支线，想清地图的玩家则会被单调重复的支线和问号无尽地折磨，而本就不算优秀的主线剧情，节奏更会被低劣的旁支内容打得支离破碎。
[strike]合理化建议：下次加一个杀宝箱找队长[/strike]

育碧的公式化开放世界对我这种喜欢打全成就甚至100%的玩家是毁灭打击，不难，但是恶心，极度恶心。好比工业化快餐，标准化品控，标准化口味，标准化营养，满足人的一切基本需求，你尝了一口感觉还行，阿育听了欣喜若狂，一年三百六十五天，一天早中晚三顿天天给你塞这一顿饭，吃之前你光用想象就能体味到这一口的口感和味道，说不定还能顺便心算出这口的营养含量。未来的好一段时间我都要阿育PTSD了

[u]提示：本评测体验建立于没有深入玩过SMB的基础上。[/u]
[u]提示：高度受难预警！！[/u]

接触E胖大抵是从Super Meat Boy开始的，[strike]玩了以撒好久然后突然发现“什么SMB也是他做的好神奇啊”[/strike]，SMB作为一代十分成功的平台解谜类游戏，其主题在于[b]SPEED[/b]，即速度，基本要求是玩家在短时间内做出相对连续的操作，在对关卡有一定全局观的基础上进行解谜游戏。

本作释出之前我一度十分不解，为什么E胖会再推出一款同样类型的游戏，毕竟超越同类前作并不是一件容易之事，在那个年代独立游戏一旦形成自己的品牌会很容易引起广泛关注，而如今泛滥的独立游戏，尤其是平台解谜，早已让人应接不暇。

然后我打开了游戏，废寝忘食。

[h1][b]>>画面 7<<[/b][/h1]

本作延续了E胖一直以来的涂鸦风，每个章节由于有不同的主题，会有细微区别，参考商店界面前面几张截图。[spoiler]比如Retrograde会有轻微的花屏特效，很辣眼睛x[/spoiler]

整个游玩过程中，背景配色和环境主题对解谜过程没有明显影响，没有出现遮挡染色等情况。部分章节的血红色背景长时间注视下可能引起不适，在这里预先提醒。

[h1][b]>>音效 8<<[/b][/h1]

整体背景音乐风格参考以撒，魔性程度很高，不算扰人但相对各种音效而言声音略大。在卡关和受难的时候请把bgm适当关小，[strike]这样会让你卡的开心一些。[/strike]

平台解谜的音效……应该没什么好说的吧？要我说死亡的噗叽声好听还是怎样？

[h1][b]>>操作 9<<[/b][/h1]

本作操作按钮共五个，上下左右和跳（space），引入了挂边系统可以吸附在左上或右上的拐角，引入了加速下落系统可以在空中按↓快速下落。基本操作方式衍生出的复杂操作非常之多，绝大多数情况下精确的操作可以带来绝对精准的移动，即操作可以解决问题。

当然我说的这么简单，游戏真的有这么简单就好了。

[strike]唯一缺点是不能像肉哥一样爬墙（x）[/strike]

[h1][b]>>游戏性和关卡设计 10+9<<[/b][/h1]

回到游戏本身，本作的定位是硬核平台解谜。相对SMB的冲刺风而言，更多强调精准操作、耐性和全局观。

[code]更多的还是坦然面对抖M的内心。[/code]

游戏分为主世界【The Past】篇和未来【The Future】篇，主世界共有9个主题鲜明的章节（加一个隐藏章），每章20（16）关，无限续命x，在中间分成三个分支，全部完成过后解锁未来篇。未来篇共7个章节，系主世界章节的复刻，生命数与主世界收集物tumor总数相等，每章节重置。游戏进程呈一个三线加一个单线形式，难度[b]基本[/b]线性递增。地图涉及剧透没必要放出，主世界地图可以参考我的截图：
[spoiler]
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1060765611
[/spoiler]
本作第一个特点，联通式地图。主世界的全部章节可以认为是在同一个大地图上，每个关卡的独立性是十分相对的，关卡之间、章节之间是互相连通的，很多隐藏关甚至主体关卡都可能联通了好几个其他关卡。[spoiler]进某个隐藏关不慎失足结果掉到了前一个章节第19关这种破事我就不提了。[/spoiler]这种非线性的地图设置一方面极大地增加了理解地图和找隐藏关的难度（尤其后期），相对其他同类游戏，对玩家整体感知的要求会更高；另一方面既然地图都是连在一起的，不打完一章是不是，不太好意思休息啊？

第二个特点，多样化的操作细节。每章不同的主题并不局限于背景和画风，更会影响到解谜本身。不同的操作细节和障碍随着关卡的进行会逐渐引入，每章的整体解谜思路会相差甚远，但后期难度整体远高于前期，且收集物和隐藏关难度可能非常之高。作为一个[b]并不十分擅长硬核平台类游戏[/b]的玩家，选择性放弃了少数需要极限操作或者极限运气的收集物（主世界进度94%）。就先前收集到的428个tumor而言，很多高难度关卡需要从一开始认真理解整个地图和规划路线，细化操作（比如记住哪些地方要小跳，比小跳高一点，大跳，满跳等等）。其困难要素很大程度上源于对玩家[b]耐心[/b]和[b]韧性[/b]的要求，正如大多数受苦游戏一样，你可能需要几十甚至数百次尝试才能做出一次漂亮的完美操作，但多数情况下这样的尝试最终会带来极大的成就感，[spoiler]不能的我都骂完一遍了x[/spoiler]

全收集的话，参考这篇评测，可以说十分详细了（当然是英文，但是图很清楚）。

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=975594321

第三个特点，分级化的难度设置。值得庆幸的是，E胖是一个良心还可以的游戏商，如果不作收集的话，其实通关主世界并不是一件很难的事情，也就最后[spoiler]Machine[/spoiler]一章难度相对高一些，在3-4小时左右可以完成整个流程，我们认为这是第一级。

然后回头试图完成全收集。事实上70%+的收集物都并不在原路上，很多还需要从关卡终点反向找路，所以[b]不考虑难度因素[/b]也需要多个周目才能完成收集。大多数的收集物难度不会太高，这是第二级。

继续进行Future篇章，由于需要有主世界收集物作为生命基数，在没有收集到较多灵魂之前不建议去开荒，因为死了要重打整个章节[spoiler]（我Anguish脑抽卡在过第20关 真的 超绝望 其实跳一下就上去了）[/spoiler]，虽然和主世界用的是[b]大体[/b]相同的图，但难度高了非常之多，第三级。

最后是剩余相对极限的收集物、隐藏关和隐藏章节。本作部分收集物需要十分极限的操作，少数需要一定随机性的运气成分，我窃以为这一部分针对的要不是硬核大佬，要不是受难成性玩家，反正大抵不适合大多数受众，毕竟硬核嘛！

无责任推荐高数(@rjdimo)的73分钟速通视频，可以说十分恐怖了。

https://www.bilibili.com/video/av12346420/

[h1][b]>>成就与重复可玩性 8<<[/b][/h1]

[code]本作[b]十分不建议[/b]刷全成就[/code]

游戏成就有两大部分，一个是游戏主体，一个是小游戏。我完成主世界过后只拿到了16/105个成就，可以说十分的恐怖。游戏本体基本是进度成就、收集成就这样的基本套路，无需赘述（哦真的么）。小游戏的话，每一章里面会有一个隐藏的磁盘收集物，收集到了过后可以到第一章开头的房间里面开电视玩，是类似本体游戏的小游戏，8-bit画风，8-bit bgm，就当小霸王玩就好了。每个小游戏都有数个成就，也都是进度成就、收集成就。

[strike]其实我不知道死亡有没有成就，毕竟我才死了6k+次而已，还行。[/strike]

[b]说这么轻易好像这游戏成就很简单一样！谁快来打给我看！[/b]

[h1][b]<<整体 8.9/10[/b][/h1]

一部不同受众都可以体验的硬核本质平台解谜类游戏，E胖的又一力作。

其实我也说不好和肉哥那个难毕竟我太菜了。

[code]无限受难，量力而行。[/code]

I swear this game can be good and fun, but as of right now it is just frustrating to play, especially since i rarely play and am against the very few people who know exactly what to do all the time. Hoping that a big update comes and attempts to save the game because it can be very fun to play.

Dead Cells,schinese,在连刷了数天之后对“肝”亡细胞和死“手”细胞做个简单的小测评。游戏的打击感和操作顺滑度是一流的，玩起来就是一个爽字。装备和法术也多样性且很有特色，三色系统配合不同的异变有可挖掘的多样的打法。但是与其说是绝佳的roguelike游戏，不如说他是绝佳的动作游戏，roguelike元素更像是增色作用而并非核心玩法。游戏流程非常长，有0至5细胞6种游戏难度同时也是剧情的推进，除5细胞外都是3个boss一个流程，路线可选，根据需要不只是路经的物品还有路线长短，固定boos这一点也是和其他roguelike游戏不一样的地方，意味着全流程是可规划，可重复，可练习的。但是，还是想弱弱地问一句，4细胞5细胞是给正常的人类能够打通的吗（流汗），0细胞还能正常通关，1细胞开始用sl大法了，再往后要是不借用工具恐怕100h、200h还在梦开始的地方。,

怎么评价这个游戏呢，很好，很优秀的jrpg，我很推荐。
画风是宫崎骏画风，音乐也不错，总的来说，卖相很好，然后游戏的内核也很丰富，剧情简单，是个很肝的游戏，在jrpg中应该算是比较优秀的了，也算是很典型的jrpg了。
只是不适合我，我喜欢肝的游戏，但它不是我的菜。肝装备的获得感不强，战斗不够爽快，虽然是即时战斗，但是只能遇到然后再战斗这种类型给我拖沓的感觉，我十分不喜欢，尽管战斗画面还算不错。
总的来说，喜欢jrpg的应该玩玩这游戏，想要入坑jrpg的也可以通过这个游戏入坑，很适合，也不难，喜欢这种画风的也可以入坑。但是不喜欢肝的，或者整体兴趣不大的，不推荐入，或者等打骨折再入，大概这样。",Zen Yao Ping Jie Zhe Ge You Xi Ni Hen Hao Hen You Xiu De jrpgWo Hen Tui Jian

Why?
Because most ""JPRG""'s are mopey sadsacks that are all about being as brooding and angsty as possible.
Now we have a game that exudes positivity. This is a very upbeat, very corny game, and I think I like it that way.
For too long the world has been without a game that reminds me of the heroism and adventure like Skies of Arcadia, and I felt like it scratched that itch for me.

Is it perfect? Hell no. Combat feels similar to FFXV in that it feels like you're slapping enemies for 5 or so minutes. But I really enjoyed the stories, the characters, and the kingdom building elements.

Ni no Kuni™ II: Revenant Kingdom,schinese,"剧情上很王道的一部日式RPG。

可以看出玩法上尽量的加入了很多元素，但是过于繁杂的元素使得剧情体验很不流畅，同时一直在改变的画风（手绘和3D建模）让人很难有侵入式体验。即使加入DLC，整个游戏剧情还是很短，明明地图很大但是利用率却很低。（战争模式真的又无聊又复杂，流程还特长）涉及剧透的就不聊了。主线剧情也是并不觉得有趣和感动（传说系列已经很不好了，居然还没有传说系列的剧情走心），支线任务也很单一。（大概是因为每次都拿空轨的剧情作为标杆，要求也比较高 ）

游戏其实还是不错的（本人是冲着这个吉卜力的画风入的），但是整体体验配不上这个价格。建议不要原价购买。反正个人还是很失望的。

Ni no Kuni™ II: Revenant Kingdom,schinese,"很久没玩日式RPG，对于日式RPG的印象无非还是无尽的战斗，无尽的道具，无尽的迷宫，俗套的剧情，多角色战斗……
本作也依然具有以上的特点，出于对宫崎骏画风的喜爱，开坑！
可以说本作还是给我不少惊喜的，踩地雷的战斗和迷宫无缝衔接的战斗交替，战斗和经营的结合，都丰富了游戏的玩法和支撑了游戏可玩性！如果没有城池建造，我就不需要那么多工具人，不需要工具人，那就不需要做支线任务，不做支线任务，那我只做剧情任务，如果遇到卡级，那就要无趣的刷等级，那这游戏的节奏就会变得非常难受！
部队战斗有点稍显鸡肋，并没有太多切合点，除了最终挑战大BOSS之前是采取了这个战斗模式，但本质上还是有点尴尬，两套关联度不大的战斗机制放一起很难平衡，也分散了对于角色本身能力的培养！
另外游戏设计了几种元素以及抗性之类的，看起来是有相克关系的，但实际游戏过程中，体现得并不明显，有这功夫还不如提升等级等级压制来得效果好，装备只要数值高就可以了，反正直到通关，我都没太搞清楚这些个元素的影响！
道具种类非常得多，大多用不到，沦为酒馆任务材料，其实可以用来制作，但实际使用率不高！强化也没用，城池要上4级非常麻烦，主要是要100个工具人，我做到93个放弃了，但这个点，确实把整个游戏的元素给串起来了，从设计本身上说是非常成功的！
DLC部分，兔子旅馆、黑龙王，都算是在给游戏续命，还算可以吧！
由于不是单调推剧情，刷等级，游戏玩起来还是很上瘾的，画风可爱，配乐也还算不错，就是数量少了些，总体上还是值得推荐的！
购买建议是，直接入手王子版，之前HB百代促销，80左右就可以买到，个人觉得游戏内容和游戏时长还是物有所值的！",

至于最后为什么和杀父仇人结盟，参见《菊与刀》这本书就能了解了。海洋都市300年的时间只是静止了，主角去过以后时间才开始流逝，所以崩坏并没有那么快，准确来说，应该是游戏世界的1年多以后这个城市才会消失，这点可以通过一个小女孩的蜥蜴宠物这个支线任务得到确认。既然还有一年多时间，那女王完全有机会去寻找另外一个见过的地方，就是300年前为什么不这么做呢。",

Ni no Kuni™ II: Revenant Kingdom,schinese,年纪大了就喜欢玩这种单纯的游戏，大家都是傻白甜，除了某老鼠。战斗感我觉得挺不错的，自动锁定有点沙雕。最开始觉得魔法就是渣渣，快通关了拿了魔法大师才觉得魔法有用了。进军有些创意吧，不过进军动画实在是太慢了，还不能跳过，每次打都要看一遍。游戏很多地方都有自动存档，例如打魔障怪，但是唯独一次坑了我的就是兔子梦境的最后一环，不能存档，没有提示，我本来打算试一下最终BOSS的节奏，死了就算了，之后自动读档再打的，结果死了就回到了上上个BOSS，真的是坑。,

Ni no Kuni™ II: Revenant Kingdom,schinese,"讲真，现在游戏时长24小时，有点不想继续玩下去了。
这个游戏优缺点真的太明显了，优点让人拍案叫绝，缺点让人摇头叹气。
百濑义行设计的角色，吉卜力的画风，久石让的配乐，哪一个都是经典。说实话，我光截图就截了159张。不过游戏的配乐单独听原声的时候不太行，在不同场景时倒是挺协调。
游戏内容也挺丰富，各种支线，各种玩法层出不穷。有到处探索，即时战斗的，也有小股部队配合作战的，更有模拟经营建立王城的，甚至还有肉鸽来客下地牢的，游戏内容多得人应付不过来。
但是这个游戏我实在是不想继续下去了，王子复国的剧情本来就是老生常谈，看一眼开头就知道了结尾。剧情方面没什么波动起伏，平淡如水，虽然说偶尔会有点小惊喜，但确实没什么推剧情的动力了，毕竟你是一个rpg游戏，剧情平淡就判了死刑。
游戏里面战斗是即时战斗，但是掉落的装备来来回回就那么几种，一点都不炫酷，技能也不多，打怪是相当枯燥。尤其是你到了一个新地图，看到一大片新地图等着你开荒，想到接踵而来的枯燥剧情，真的是没有了玩下去的动力。
如果我能继续玩下去，那么必定是为了截图去的，游戏彩蛋也有不少，倒是有点惊喜。",

Ni no Kuni™ II: Revenant Kingdom,japanese,"つまらないです。それもとてつもなく。
Prince's Editionを購入。クリア済み。

【良かったところ】

・ジェネリックジブリなアニメ調3Dキャラは、本当にジブリアニメそのもののような完成度。

・マップ移動はテレポ使い放題、クエスト目標地点のマーカーもマップに表示してくれる親切設計。

【嫌だったところ】

・お値段が激しくおま値。
　Steam北米価格 $59.99 : Steam日本価格  8,640円
　Prince's Edition Steam北米価格 $79.98 : Steam日本価格 10,800円 
　
・ストーリーはいわゆる一本糞。シナリオ本編は攻略順などなしに指示されるままに進めるだけである。

・個人的にはストーリーが非常に退屈だった。
　後付けの説明で「実は・・・」という似たようなストーリー展開ばかりで、そこにいたる導線などは上手く作られていないため、つまんない自分語りを延々聞かされているような気分になりがちだった。
[spoiler]　例えば、ラスボスと戦う時に唐突に彼の悲しい過去が明らかになるのだが、非道を働いてきたラスボスの事情とかいきなり語られても知らんがな。[/spoiler]

・簡単だが面倒でストレスフルなマップギミック。
　終盤に入るまでは各章のストーリーで攻略するダンジョン1つずつに必ず固有のマップギミックがある。スイッチを押したり、一方通行だったりするアレである。
　個々のギミックは恐ろしく凡庸で簡単なのだけれど、どのステージもマップの段差で視界が遮られるという駄目な理由で正解ルートを見失いやすく、ひたすらマップ内を歩き回る羽目になることが多々あり、つまらなく面倒くさい。
　正しい意味でレベルデザインに失敗していると言えると思う。

・非常につまらない戦闘。
　敵が頻繁にプレイヤーをノックバック。発動を簡単に潰されるプレイヤーの必殺技。
　敵の突進技が回避しても回避先にホーミングしてくる、アクションゲームとしては駄目な敵アルゴリズム。
　これらの絶妙なハーモニーにより、戦闘ではプレイヤーが技術介入しにくい。
　ノックバックで小突かれず快適に戦うためには味方に肉壁をさせて遠距離からプスプス敵を射殺する以外の解決法があまりない。

・サブクエストがとてつもなく不愉快でつまらない。
　サブクエストのほぼ全てで、自己中な発言のNPCたちにおつかいでこき使われる。多くのNPCは3回はおつかいをおかわりしてようやく満足し、サブクエストが1個達成となる。
　NPCの台詞はほぼほぼ自分勝手なものばかりで、ライターはユーモラスなつもりだったのだろうけれど不愉快でしかないものが多い。

・王国運営のキングダムモードはクッキークリッカーを100倍つまらなくしたものを想像するとだいたい合ってる。

・進軍バトルは古代のボコスカウォーズに似ている。軍団の塊で体当たりするだけであり、つまり面白くない。

・魔瘴気モンスターという中ボスとの戦闘中にクラッシュする不具合がある模様。
　複数のモンスターで確認しているので、おそらく魔瘴気モンスター特有のエフェクトや背景に原因があるのではないかと思われる。

战棋游戏已是弱势的游戏模式，出彩不易，值得一试。
以“破阵”为主要线索，行动上自由度不高，每回合都在解决地方对于建筑、机甲的威胁。
过关要求也以生存为主，杀敌、保护等为辅的多种过关模式。造成伤害也不再是唯一方式、手段，地形、干扰，以及此乃驱虎吞狼之计。
不友好的SL，有且仅有一次回滚到上回合，对于重新布局本关只能手动备份，不然只能丢掉此次时间线了。

Into the Breach,japanese,"正式な日本語サポートを機に、フレンドが序盤をプレイする様子を見せてもらったところ面白そうだったので購入してプレイ。
8x8の小さな盤面の上に立つ巨大生物とロボが5ターンという短い間に織りなす、一見シンプルなルールながらも脳をフル回転させてじっくり考えさせられる危機の連続は瞬く間に私を虜にし、気がついたら朝を迎えていた。

他のレビューアが山のように書いている通り、雰囲気は詰め将棋に近いかもしれないが、読み合いという意味においてはもっと場当たり的で、それでいて常に最適解を求められる。詰め将棋は手数と盤面の複雑さによって難易度を調整するのに対して、このゲームは純粋に一度に沸いてくる敵の数・性能・そして配置が難易度を変える。

そしてこのゲームの素晴らしくもあり恐ろしくもある部分はその難易度の絶妙さだ。
こちらが操作できる機体は3体に対して敵はそれ以上出現し、街を狙う敵を退けながらも数を減らさなければならない。つまりほとんどの場合において一見すると彼我の戦力差は理不尽なまでに不平等であり、人類は追い詰められている。
しかし操作する3体の各装備とパイロットの特性が生み出すシナジーや、初期配置を含む5ターンの立ち回りといった、プレイヤーの選択が結果として良い作用を引き起こすことができれば、絶望的な盤面も無傷でひっくり返すことができる。

敵AIは多少のランダム性を持った比較的シンプルに思えるアルゴリズムで動作し、その様子はまさに本能のままに襲い来る巨大な虫たちであり、敵に司令塔はいない。であるのにも関わらず、最適解を積み上げている限りにおいてはまるで仕組まれたかのように「考え抜けばどうにかなる」ことがあまりにも多い。そして逆にヌルい手を打てばお仕置きとばかりに次のターンで絶望を味わう。

果たして伝わるだろうか。小さな世界と、数と力しかないバカなはずの敵たちが引き起こすこの不思議な現象そのものが、本ゲームが成したデザインの美学だと私は考えている。私はこのゲームの面白さだけでなく、ゲームデザインに戦慄する感覚をもっと多くの人と共有したいのだ。
",
Into the Breach,english,"Strategy on 8x8 field, which is fun and challenging at the same time.",strategy onfield which is fun challenging at same time
Into the Breach,japanese,"1マップ8x8の大きさで、たった5ターンの戦い。
それだけ聞くとあっという間に終わりそうな感じですが、実際は猛烈に頭をひねって長時間試行錯誤するゲームです。
攻撃面でのランダム要素は一切なく、必ず命中し、ダメージも武器ごとに固定です。
攻撃の種類によっては相手を押しのけたりすることが可能で、壁にぶつけたり湖に突き落としたりすることで、より早く敵を片付けられます。
一方で自分のチームは、各所に配置されている町を防衛する必要があり、それらを攻撃されたり、うっかり自分で傷つけてしまわないように、気をつけることも大事。
敵の増援もワラワラ湧いてくるので、以下に敵を早く片付け、あるいは出現を防ぎ、なおかつ町を守ることになります。

とにかく考えることがたくさんのゲームです！
あーでもないこーでもないも考えた末に、うまく作戦がハマったときは爽快です。
ただし、ほんの少しのミスが大惨事を招くこともあります。

このゲームはセーブポイントから何度もやり直すことが不可能であり、一度始めると最後までやられずにやり通すことになります。
ゲームオーバーになると、何もかもを失うことになる、非常にハードコアなゲームです。

人如其名，突破，玩家所要做的只是一次又一次把自己置身敌众我寡的逆境中并且一次又一次突破，也是突破自己寻找最优解。
作为一款小品SLG，紧凑又精巧，三机五回合64格应付愈发困难应对无法彻底根除的虫群，一次又一次逼迫你去寻找最优解处理残局，更多的时候比起击杀你能做的仅仅只是挪开敌人甚至是把攻击方向改成自己去保护仅存的建筑物；置身逆境寻求突破既是游戏名称也是游戏的核心，玩家绝大多数情况下都是被动的，即便神装就位来势汹汹也仅仅是处于攻势防御罢，随着难度提升你能做到的事情愈发减少，贪图更多的收益成了奢望，万变不离其宗的依然是对综合利益的权衡与抉择，很可能接踵而来的就是满级穿越者机师的生命与最后一节电源之间的电车难题，一切的一切都是基于简单的游戏机制设计的，让人叹服。
与常见的SLG不一样的是，游戏中比拼的数值并不大，而游戏的目的更多的也是保护我方＞歼灭敌方，歼灭这一情况更多的是贪婪的奖励，这就带来了游戏机制上特别讨喜的两点：出于保护＞歼灭的情况游戏以干扰与位移阻挠虫群的攻势为主，而在满足了保护的前提下追求歼灭——游戏中的高伤害往往依托精妙的武器特性连携配合与地形相辅相成而不是单纯的堆砌数字。而保护和歼灭也是可以相结合的，那便是游戏中玩家所追求的利益最大化，也是无数场战斗中突破逆境的，丝血的建筑的护盾能在排挤敌人的同时部署，挪开偷袭研究所的敌人可以堵塞下回合的增援，潮汐与酸液、山脉与裂隙、旧式的军队也好先进的科学船也罢你要做的就是寻找当下他们物尽其用的有机结合。
全成就通关都有两年了，今天才发现这游戏前几个月出官中了，也不知道为什么以前没写过评测，我向来是对紧凑又精巧的游戏无法抗拒，有什么理由让我不给好评呢？",into breach
Into the Breach,schinese,"陷阵之志是个蛮不错的战棋游戏，带有肉鸽元素，很喜欢这种科幻背景+像素风格的游戏，一共四类机甲，几十种技能，在配上16个带有特殊技能的驾驶员，可玩性挺高的。

比较难受的一点是不能随意存读档，一场战斗四回合，只允许重试一回合（有个驾驶员可以再多一次），不过思考时间是无限的，不考虑手残点错的话一次绰绰有余了。

但是这游戏内容比较少，敌人数量，地图关卡都非常有限，初玩非常有趣，玩多了就索然无味了。",

ナンバリング的にはMMOを作った後の為
システム周りは今までにない目新しさがあった

PS2の時は実はクリアまでやらず手前で積んでしまったが
今回は2倍速と4倍速モードがあったのでレベル上げ等も比較的楽で最後までそれなりに楽しめた

が、まぁしかし正直なところ

ストーリーは戦争や政治の話がメインで退屈気味
せめて感情移入出来るキャラや見せ方があれば違ったが残念ながら特になかった。

恐らくだけど長い小説を映画化した時によくある
人物の背景や細かい設定を見せきれず
風呂敷が広がったまま、よくわからない部分が多々あるままエンディングを迎えた感じ。

操作時のヴァンとパンネロのモデリングが当時のままで不細工なのが一番不満だった。

FINAL FANTASY XII THE ZODIAC AGE,schinese,"在我的游史观感中，FFXII绝对算一款毁誉参半的作品。作为RPG，它提供了超前的模式和丰富的玩法。相比传统日式RPG改动非常激进，但激进又不彻底激进，一方面被Title束缚，从而保留了指令式选项和必杀技尬演。一方面提供过多的系统设置选择（如敌我连线开关），表明制作人自身的犹豫和对大众的妥协。

而且，游戏时而透出一股强烈的脱了裤子放屁感。更有甚者，某些系统还向玩家兜售上帝视角成分，上帝视角成分，如果玩家对RPG代入感有要求有执念的话，这种成分，怕只能是糟粕。

为创新而创新，既超前又守旧，是FF这个系列一直难以摆脱的困境。对此，每当系列有新作放出，有的人兴奋啊。但还有一些人，怕了。

往难听了说，这就是一款编程游戏，提前设置好你想要的一切，看它能否顺利运行，仅此而已。往好听了说，人人都有做实验的需求，想挑战自己运筹帷幄的方面，看着它们发生，或许大部分人都能观察到最后。

FFXII，起初我喜欢这个游戏。但它卖弄浮夸的部分，让我想起了FFVIII，于是我不怎么喜欢这个游戏了。

Darksiders III,schinese,"65小时终于全成就了天启四骑士的第三部作品，这作终于开始准备回收前两部剧情埋下的伏笔了。结局使我属实舒服，仿佛又体会到了战争当年捏碎封印后说我不是一人的激动。这一作总结来说就是用鬼泣的地图设计玩了一个类魂作品，难度比前作有所提升。如果你刚接触暗黑血统，这一作我是不推荐的，因为它不太具有前两作的特点，反而是一个中和的试验性作品。但如果你是暗黑血统的老玩家，那这作必然是完整暗黑血统世界观必要的过度作品，还是推荐的。下面简单说一下优缺点：
优点：
1. 地图设计是那种通过学习新技能不断解锁新区域的玩法，我一直蛮喜欢这种设计的。
2. 武器和道具较先前作品为最丰富，战斗体验很爽快。
缺点：
1.这作最高难度真的很难很难，如果你没有足够的耐心和毅力请不要一周目尝试最高难度。但我认为整体而言这个游戏在难度控制上是失败的，整个游戏都能看出对魂拙劣的模仿痕迹，但却又给玩家提供了不同的难度选择。如果玩家选择相对简单的难度，道具与等级却又对人物的加成过大，这会导致后期战斗毫无挑战性。
2.大部分boss AI略为简单，基本每个阶段就是重复随机的几个动作。
3.dlc真的很拉跨，大量重复内容，武器与boss战除了满足情怀外，其余全部用换颜色换贴图的方式堆砌。
4.全成就需要包含dlc，而且需要进行大量的重复刷魂，较为枯燥。",

Darksiders III,schinese,这游戏买了好久 最近说拿来玩玩，一周目通了之后（中间玩发现不能获得成就，我也没有在意，以为一周目通了应该一起给？）成就一个都没给，然后心想算了，玩玩DLC吧，结果蛇径根本没有熔炼厂，一直是锁着的状态，卸了再安也不行，DLC卸了再安也不行。越是玩不了越想玩，结果弄了一晚上，彻底放弃了，等于DLC一个没玩，成就一个没得。真服了。,Zhe You Xi Mai Liao Hao Jiu

Darksiders III,japanese,"前作のパズルが苦手だったので、今作のパズル少な目とあっても簡単なパズルで戦闘特化のような気がして楽しめました。
武器はムチのほかにストーリーが進むと4つ解放されていきます。
途中から防御してくる敵が出てきますが、この敵は3つ目に手に入れるハンマーみたいな武器でガードを崩せます。

ストーリーは正直ってわかりませんが、とにかく戦闘が楽しかった。画面外からの攻撃もあるのである程度見切って動かないと駄目な部分があります。戦闘自体はダークソウル系ですがそこまで難しくないかな。

フュリーが7つの大罪を捕まえるために奔走する物語です。ネタバレになってしまいますが、最後にフュリーが7つの大罪を人間界に放ったのは人間界を滅ぼすためだと気づいたところであながち間違っていない解釈だなと思いました。エンディングもよかったですね。続編に繋がる感じの終わり方です。次がストレイフだとしてももっと続きそうな感じがします。

CHRONO TRIGGER,tchinese,"[h1] 劇情	[/h1]
遊戲圍繞在時間旅行之中,主角在意外中穿越了時空,並在未來中得知了未來會被一隻名叫拉維斯的大魔獸摧毀,所以主角開始回到過去,包含了恐龍時代 古魔法時代 中世紀 現代與未來,穿梭在各種時空中並且在途中遇到許多同伴加上熱門王道劇情,最後一起擊敗拉維斯

像是在主線上,一開始主角一行在中世紀幫助擊敗的魔王,竟然也是想要殺真正的大魔獸.主角們後來到了古魔法時代,才發現魔王竟然是被拉維斯消滅的魔法族的王子.最後魔王也加入主角的行列,一起去把拉維斯給打敗

而在穿越時空這一點上許多支線劇情也與此有關.像是在中世紀在沙漠幫助植樹到了現代就會變成森林,而要完成這一點就必需把同伴之一的機器人留在過去.因為支線主角也是人,會死去無法完成這個志願.機器人可以一直工作,最後經過400年,終於讓沙漠變森林.未來還成立一間寺廟,祭侍機器人和那位執行願望的人

也有像是需要長時間照著太陽才能恢復能量的太陽石,就必需去原始時代放下來,再去未來把吸收了幾萬年太陽光的太陽石回收,才能夠解完事件

到了劇情中期的時候會對上拉維斯,拉維斯的強大擊敗了主角一行人而主角為了救大家而死去.結果在主角死後同伴為了救主角,還需要去找到主角的蠟像,然後透過一些重要道具把時間轉換到當時主角被殺的時候,在時間暫停之下把主角真身和蠟像交換,讓主角復活

整體來說,劇情透過不同時間的前後順序與因果關係,讓整個遊戲充滿了發現過去的真相與改變未來的結果的事件,經過巧思後,最終遊戲製造了充滿感動和熱血的劇情

在有著時間旅行的遊戲類型上,遊戲界是有不少的.但是整個劇情,事件以及一些少細節,均可做到時間概念來表達,在我的印象中,超時空之鑰是唯一的一款，也是至今時間旅行類型中最完整的一款.所以也不難怪超時空之鑰在2018 IGN TOP100上依然能夠保持20名以內

[h1]戰鬥 	[/h1]
遊戲中共有七個可操控角色,而每個角色之間會有不同的組合技,單論角色我認為在當時1995年可以做到有七個已經是很誇張而每個角色在不斷殺怪的過程中學習到的技能,玩家可以看出角色有在成長,而角色的技能會與不同角色產生出互動,這點也大大增加了遊戲趣味性.

超時空之鑰戰鬥是使用ATB戰鬥時間條系統.角色在戰鬥中如要使用二人技或是三人合體技,必需要等到二個人或是三個人都有空時，才能夠發揮
像是有個角色本回合用治療法術,那其他二個人頂多只能發揮二人合體技,或是必需等到二個人都能夠動時,才能夠發動回復所有人的多人回血術,加上每個人的時間條速度不一,而在組合技上也分成了直線,圓形,橫向的傷害範圍,戰鬥途中敵人也會隨時間移動,所以觀察敵人的移動進行攻擊,讓戰鬥變的異常有趣

而在對戰強大敵人之前,可以向城鎮中的NPC對話而知道敵人弱點,而在戰鬥中,也不可以盲目地攻擊,需要觀察弱點才可擊敗,我認為這種模式,對我而言,是特別與創新的出色設計,可以讓到玩家十分投入在遊戲中

[h1]結論 	[/h1]
雖然遊戲已經是十多年前的遊戲,畫面畫質可能對於現時處於快餐模式,畫面要求十分高的玩家來說做不到吸引,但只要忍受一下這十多年前的畫質,超時空之鑰一定可以令你享受到豐富多彩的冒險",Ju Qing  Gu Mo Fa Shi Dai  Zhong Shi Ji

スクウェア（現スクウェア・エニックス）から発売された、まさに[b]不朽の名作[/b]と呼ぶに相応しいRPG。当時小学生だった自分は、SFCで少し触っていただけでしたが、社会人になった今、やっとクリアーまで遊ぶことができました。

キャラクター一人一人の背景、心地の良いBGM。レベル上げで足を止めることのないゲームバランス。そして一周だけでは遊び足りないほどの設定の細かさと、当時は画期的だったマルチエンディング。

物語の進み方がとてもシンプルな上[b]強くてニューゲーム[/b]があるので、二周目以降も苦になることは殆どないです。友人宅で開始から数分もせずにラスボスと戦闘できたのを見た時は、子供心にも衝撃でした。


過去での行いが、未来の世界に反映される。という[b]時を超えるシステム[/b]ならではのギミックも、このゲームの面白さの一つだと思います。過去で宝箱を開けたら未来で中身を回収できないものもあるなど、本当に細かい。

某誌で[b]『平成のベストゲーム第一位』[/b]に選ばれたのも納得の一本です。

CHRONO TRIGGER,schinese,"毫无疑问的好评。CHRONO TRIGGER（简称CT）不愧是IGN评选的百大RPG第一的名作。STEAM版本在历经SE被差评轰炸之后难得良心的5次更新，总算从劣质手游移植变得像个正儿八经的游戏了，可以在PC端体验这款诞生于1995年却毫不过时的JRPG。带有中文的steam版本的CT 非常值得玩家体验。（手机上没玩过不清楚）
个人对STEAM上的CT可以给满分的评价，从游戏性，剧情，画面以及配乐都是可以说超越时代不失魅力的完美。作为一个没玩过SFC原版，PS重制版，NDS重制版的玩家，在发售24年后来玩这么一款经典游戏，能更清楚发现，游戏业界这么多年来的变化。
提到这款作品，有两个有意思的地方，一个是在游戏结局3中都被引用的“DREAM”三巨头：《最终幻想》坂口博信；剧本撰写：《勇者斗恶龙》堀井雄二；人物设计：《七龙珠》鸟山明。对于对JRPG有所了解的玩家来说，这三位可以说是鼎鼎有名.不过事实上虽然不能说着三位大佬跟游戏毫无关系，但是关系真的不如想象中那么密切，根据VGTIME的研究坂口博信的工作基本由北濑佳范所完成，堀井雄二的工作也是由加藤正人所完成，也只有鸟山明算完成的比较多，把主要角色的人设完成，然后找来一群漫画家给他代笔完成其他角色，谁叫鸟山明的风格如此特殊呢。 不过说三巨头也有北濑佳范 加藤正人 以及现在鼎鼎有名的光田康典。
另一个有意思的莫过于CHRONO TRIGGER这个译名了，港台地区的超时空之钥算是比较正确的翻译，然后到国内不知怎就变成了时空之轮，延续至今甚至成了大陆地区约定俗成的官方译名。
说了很多题外话只是想凑凑行数，下面会有剧透而且还不准备用黑色隐藏。
先说画面：这款诞生于1995年的游戏的画面在商店介绍里就把特点展现出来了。在当时是标杆级的画面与细节表现力，像素小人的寥寥几个动作就能将内心情感传递给隔着屏幕的玩家，甚为震撼。现在独立游戏一水儿的像素风走复古，为什么真正的古典像素会成为问题呢？不过也很可惜,SE多半是不会给CT 3D高清重制了。另外游戏含有当年PS重制版的动画片段。在游戏刚开始就可以看到，浓浓的鸟山明风格...
游戏性方面：可能会有玩家也想体会这款天下第一RPG，但是对JRPG那冗长繁琐的：暗雷遇敌，回合制互砍这些及其不流畅战斗设计的固有印象会望而却步，毕竟现在新作大作那么多，而且爽玩。CT 还算好，是ATB（即时回合制），能给玩家一点点古老的JRPG的风味却不会被又臭又长的回合制对砍所吓退。抛弃暗雷的遇怪机制，改为了可见敌人以及迷宫固定点碰怪。只能说还行，多利用逃跑能节省不少时间。对回合制只要不是极度厌恶应该都还能接受着 CT的战斗系统，也能慢慢体会乐趣。
CT中 伤害为物理和魔法伤害，魔法分为水火雷（天）暗。在BOSS战中就会涉及到这些，弱点针对成为了BOSS战的关键。若不清楚BOSS的弱点，卡关在所难免。练级反而不是很关键，经验值和技能分开，只要刷到足够的技能点学到所有技能，然后支线提供的各个角色最强装备拿到，通关不是特别困难。
来说下配乐，画面和游戏性可能受累于年代的因素，现在看来的确有一点点古老了。但是不禁再此要大吹特吹一波光田康典，完美的配乐。17岁才开始学习音乐的光田康典在23岁为CT做出如此杰出的配乐（还是光田的处女作），可以说是一鸣惊人，不禁让人感慨，这就是天才啊。即使不玩CT，也可以去听一听CT的原声集，以及光田康典的其他作品。一定不会让人失望。
接下来是对于剧情。涉及剧透。
CT可能是最早的幼驯染输给天降系的故事，主角克鲁诺遇见公主玛尔，玛尔随后因为超时空吊坠的原因在青梅竹马发明家的时空试验中穿越到了400年前。虽然只有一面之缘，但是真男人主角毫不犹豫跳入时空隧道去拯救公主。遂开始了这段从史前6500万年开始到时间尽头的拯救世界之旅。
整个CT的剧情设计极为巧妙，一段剧情接着一段，在不停的时空穿梭中了解世界在1999年后毁灭的来龙去脉。
CT也是款主角会死的游戏，在初见最终BOSS时不敌就会掩护众人而死。玩家可以通过完成藏得挺深的线索来复活主角，深刻体会到游戏想要表达的概念。
击败最终BOSS吞噬星球的寄生虫之前才留给玩家时间来完成支线剧情，在支线中藏着游戏的最强装备，也藏着各个主角的感人剧情，都需要穿梭时空来解决问题的剧情解密设计更是巧妙绝伦。其中机器人罗伯的支线剧情可以说是难以形容的感动。
游戏拥有13个结局，其中13结局是NDS重制版加入的（NDS重制版才算良心，加入了2个大支线和迷宫，以及一个联动续作的结局）。且都可以在第二周目完成。STEAM版本CT有13个成就，各对应每个结局。一周目通关其实可以视频通关其他几个结局。因为除了涉及到复活主角的结局1 结局2 ，其他都是在不同剧情阶段打败最终BOSS的时空推演变化。

CT能获得天下第一RPG的称号可以说是不负盛名，这20多小时的一周目给我的感动是之前很少有游戏能做到的。也希望有更多的人来体验这款作品。当然SE这定价是有点高了，可以在参考18年8月22日的最低价47。",Jia Teng Zheng Ren  Yi Ji Xian Zai Ding Ding You Ming De Guang Tian Kang Dian  Ling Yi Ge You Yi Si De Mo Guo Yu chrono ctDe Zhan Dou Xi Tong Ye Neng Man Man Ti Hui Le Qu  ctZhong  Jie Xia Lai Shi Dui Yu Ju Qing She Ji Ju Tou

小白用这个游戏来学习装机也是完全可以的，游戏里有一个很详细的装机教程，虽然这么说也别以为游戏里熟练装机了现实中就肯定没问题了，诸如机箱走线、机箱风扇如何装螺丝、硅脂怎么涂、机箱螺丝孔位不对怎么办、螺丝滑丝了怎么办、主板接线具体怎么接、bios如何设置、如何装系统这些游戏里全部大大简化了，现实中远比游戏复杂很多，所以别一厢情愿能通过一个游戏完全学会装机了，最好的办法还是自己上手试一试。",

Clicker Heroes 2,schinese,"[h1]前言[/h1]

点击英雄2 现在还处于Beta测试，游戏占时不支持中文，而且开放内容非常少，并且没有云存档，最恶心的是这次存档不进行保存。如果不是点击英雄的死忠粉最好等完整版在购买。现在测试满级为199级。
 

[h1]画面上[/h1]

第二部继承啦第一部的卡通风格，玩家的英雄从一个静态的图片变成了一个会砍会放技能的英雄。地图从单纯的数字跳关变成啦一条无尽的路。第二部的画面从原来的2D变成啦现在的3D效果。地图中云会慢慢的移动，怪物变得的更加的生动，不同的世界游戏的背景也会随之改变，画面整体提升很大。


[h1]玩法上[/h1]

第二部的玩法跟第一部的玩法完全不同，可以说完全不是同一个游戏啦，第一代的玩法是通过升级许多的英雄来达到攻击提升，越后面的英雄攻击越高。而第二部玩家扮演的不再是众多的英雄，而只有一个角色，玩家通过升级装备来提升伤害。（测试：装备每10级一个小提升50级一个大提升，100级打止。在往后提升意义不大。这时候需要升级装备本身，升级装备本身获得的属性相当于第一代圣器的属性，但是4选一，有时候并没有直接想要的属性）。而点击从第一代的随便点改成啦点一下需要能量，技能需要消耗蓝的设计，通过点击屏幕，角色会做出不同的攻击方式，技能也会有相应的特效。

[h1]系统[/h1]

第二部新加入啦等级系统，通过打怪获取经验，升级提升后可以获得技能点用于学习技能和提升其他属性（类似于圣器和圣魂），第二部没有转生系统，这一作的转身系统改成通关100层后选择新的世界进行挑战。越高级的世界获得的经验越多。这一作保留啦第一部用来获得红宝石的鸟，同时还增加啦隐藏金币的拾取。鸟和金币的刷新几率可以通过升级装备来提升。第一作氪金商店变成是随机刷新的商店，进行游戏一段时间后会随机刷新商店。商店物品跟第一作差别不大。但是第二部的红宝石获取非常容易，找到一个鸟10-15个红宝石，砍怪也会有几率掉落。

[h1]新增系统[/h1]

第二部加入一挂机系统，前期就有3个挂机的选择，后面解锁需要点技能才能获得。这个系统可以自动放技能，并且可以通过选择改变技能释放的先后属性跟多少秒释放一次，但是体验非常鸡肋，这个游戏提升是要靠装备的，你不升级装备打不过还是打不过，放技能也没用。通常挂机10分钟你就打不动怪物啦！还是要全程盯着玩。

当玩家通过100层后玩家可以选择下一个世界或者重新打一把通关的世界。进入下一个世界系统会告诉你适合多少级进入，经过测试玩家升级是会提升基础攻击的。（我在27级时候不升级装备攻击为151K，30级不升级装备攻击为511K）。所以等级不到时候千万不要提前进入不然会打不过的。表示在打第二世界的时候提前啦3级进去的，然后打啦8小时才通过第二世界。

[h1]这类游戏为什么会让人沉迷[/h1]

点击英雄为什么会让人沉迷其中，其实是源自于数据属性提升的爽快感。很多人其实都没有意识到，我们玩的那些网游其实就是最典型的数据提升。这里我们不谈剧情本身。举个例子魔兽世界，1级的时候砍怪3滴血，砍5下怪就死。而110级砍怪20W血也是5下怪物。暗黑3 1级的时候砍怪1滴血。满级几亿几亿的掉血。但是怪还是要许多下才死，从白色装备刷到套装在刷到远古套装，荒古套装。从本质上并没有什么变化，但是玩家却乐在其中。点击英雄可以说把这些数据提升发挥到啦极致，我想这就是让我沉迷的原因，单纯的数字提升确实很爽。最后用一张图表达。

[h1]总结[/h1]

第二部改动非常大，可以说是换啦一个游戏啦！40小时玩下来感觉过于肝。由于退出后游戏并没有计算，只能挂着玩，而且不进行升级装备根本挂不了多久，所有玩起来非常的累。最重要一点不能狂点，能量有限，如果游戏能狂点加上动态砍怪疯狂跃进的快感，会是一个不错的游戏。不知道以后会开放什么解决这一问题，但是近期并不推荐购买。

Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online,japanese,"アクションRPG。
ネプテューヌシリーズの外伝、ネプテューヌたちが「四女神オンライン」というMMOをプレイするという設定で進行するアクションRPGだ。シンプルアクションに装備強化、多くのクエスト、高低差のある広めのステージがあり、操作キャラは全12キャラとなっている。

全体的に無難なつくりで大味なバランスになっているため、細かいところに手が届いていないような印象だ。例えば、アイテムスロットのアイテムを入れ替えたいときにはリセットして全て設定し直す必要があったり、作戦をスムーズに変更することができなかったり、AIが攻撃範囲内で段差や壁で攻撃が届かなくても延々と空振り攻撃し続けたり、敵によって戦い方を変える必要がほとんどなかったりする。個人的にはスキル攻撃時のモーションが優先されていることで、モーション中に他の操作を受け付けず近接スキル攻撃直後からスムーズな防御がしづらいことが気になった。
細かいところを挙げれば切りがないが、そうした細かいところに目をつぶればゲーム自体は十分遊べる内容だ。ボスや固い敵相手は面白味がないが、テンポ良く敵を倒して素材を拾ってステージクリアできるスピーディーな展開は良い。特に詰まるようなところもない。このシリーズが好きで手軽に遊びたいのならオススメのゲームだ。",akushiyonrpg

Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online,japanese,"タムソフト作のネプテューヌシリーズ外伝作品。ネプ子達メインキャラクター8人がMMOのCβを遊ぶだけという異色の設定。
本作の出来ははっきり言ってかなり酷い。クソゲーとまではいかないが間違いなく駄作である。
ネプテューヌシリーズとしての低いハードルを乗り越えることは十分に出来ている作品でキャラが可愛ければあとはどうでもいいという人なら迷わず買っとけと言った感じですが、そういったシリーズファンはこんなレビューなぞ見ずとっくに購入しているでしょうからそれ以外の方向けに”おすすめしない”とさせていただきます。

[u]良い点[/u]
本作における唯一の評価できる点はMMOという設定である（設定上の話でありこのゲーム自体はMMOではない）。従来作品は女神たちが殺し合う仲だったり世界の危機だったりとキャラゲーにあるまじき不必要なシリアスさが存在した。その一方本作は魔王が復活しようがクラッカーが暴れようが所詮ゲームの中の話であるためシリアスさは皆無であり、「女の子達がワイワイネトゲを遊んでいる日常物」となっている。
これによって物語は平坦になるものの、逆にキャラゲーとしての完成度は従来作品に比べて格段に上がったように思える。（プレイアブルキャラクターの少なさに目を瞑ればだが！）
それとゲーム内のキャラクターということでネプ子達の性能が従来作品と差異を出すことが出来ているのもグッド。


[u]悪い点[/u]
はっきり言って書ききれないが、大別すると「苦痛すら覚えるストーリー」と「不出来なシステム面」の２つ。

[b]ストーリー[/b]
本作のストーリーは２つに分けることが出来る。1つ目は魔王が復活して云々といった毒にも薬にもならない王道のMMOゲームとしてのストーリー。こちらは何の問題もなく寧ろ下手に力が入っていない分日常物として完成度は上がっているといってもいいだろう。酷いのは2つ目、チーターとクラッカーの話である。
以下に大雑把なストーリーを載せる。一応ネタバレなので隠します。
[spoiler]いかにも今後敵対しますといった感じのオリキャラ2名が案の定攻略が抜かされて悔しいというしょうもない理由で逆恨みしてきてチートに手を出し、「この世界で唯一絶対の姫になる」だのなんだろくっさい事を言い出す。しかしゲーム的な都合でさして強くもなくあっさり撃破。黒幕のクラッカーが出てきてチーターは許されないことをしたけど利用されただけの被害者でもあるんです的ムードに。
クラッカーはクラッカーでかつて4女神オンラインシリーズと双璧を成すゲームを作り上げたものの、それをクソゲー化させてサービス終了に至ったのを「4女神オンラインの運営によるネガキャン工作に違いない！」と考えて報復に出たというやべー奴。
クラッカーがばらまいたチートモンスターが世界を攻撃しているから倒さなきゃ！というあまりにも無理矢理な展開でネプ子達を物語に巻き込みつつ、クラッカーとGMが「食らえ、論理回路爆弾！」「甘い！そのセキュリティーホールは対策済みです！」などと2人で勝手に盛り上がりGMが勝利。
チーター2人とクラッカーは改心したのでお咎めなし、心機一転0からやり直すことになりHappyEnd☆[/spoiler]

具体的な問題点の列挙としては
・従来作品にはマジコンが悪役として登場する場合が多かったがそれらはあくまで女神たちが敵対関係を乗り越えて手を取り合うための要素であり、マジコンプレイヤーを叩くようなプロパガンダストーリーらしさはなかった。しかし本作ではチートは許されない行為であることを再三主張したり、チーターとクラッカーが改心するなど含みがあるように感じられた。これにより子供向けの道徳の授業に無理やり参加させられてるような微妙な不快さがあった。
・単純に不愉快。例えば悪意の塊のような悪役や、逆に悲しい過去がある悪役が主人公たちに悪意を向けてくるのは良い。しかしチーターとクラッカーが行動を起こしたきっかけは純粋な狂人であったり大層な理由があったりするわけでもなくしょうもない逆恨みでありこれが不愉快さしか感じられなかった。
・ネプ子達が殆ど関係ない点。勝手に逆恨みした馬鹿がチーターになったのと、無理矢理ストーリーに絡めるためにチートMobと戦うことになった点しか関係ない。
・悪役3人がお咎めなし＆本当は良い子なんですアピール。わざわざ具体的に指摘する必要もない位糞糞うんち。

[b]システム面[/b]
とにかく様々な点で出来が悪い。未完成のまま売り出されたと形容するほどではないものの、まさしくβ版といった感じの微妙な至らなさが目立つ。ゲームとして致命的というほどのものはなく、アプデを何度かすればほとんど解決できそうではあるものの本作は碌にアプデもされずDLCも出さずに終わったタムソフトらしい作品である

特に気になった点を箇条書きで列挙すると
・コンボ数がカウントされそれによって火力が変ったりもするゲームなのに、敵が円を描くように移動したりと攻撃を避けようとする点
・前進を伴うスキルなどで敵のポリゴンにキャラクターが埋まって動けなくなる点。ボス戦で前衛キャラに高確率で発生する
・ステップが入力方向関係なしに前方ステップになるバグ、また入力方向と真逆の方向へのステップになるバグ。ガードよりもステップがメインになる後衛キャラにとって致命的で、一定距離を維持しようとしてステップをした結果攻撃範囲に突っ込んで死亡も日常
・マルチが1戦ごとに強制解散、部屋主がやられたらゲームオーバーで強制解散。マルチが過疎ってる最大の理由
・あまりにもガバガバな味方AI。全然攻撃せずしょっちゅう棒立ちになる。弱点属性を一切考慮しない。回復やバフをしっかり打たない。バフが切れていなくても関係なくバフを打つ。また高い再現性で自己バフを只管打ち続ける現象を確認済み
・ボスに弱点属性が存在せず戦略性が狭まっている
・ロックオンの射程が短く、ボスやビッグスライヌなどはロックオンの射程よりも広い攻撃範囲を持っているため後衛キャラであろうと常に敵の攻撃範囲での戦闘を求められる
・ネプギア専用魔法以外の魔法の性能が低すぎる為キャラ格差に繋がっている
・ガードブレイク削りと覚醒ゲージ溜めが手数依存なので手数の多少がキャラ格差に繋がっている
・アクセサリの位置調節機能がとても使いにくいうえに勝手に位置が変わるバグなどもあり、とても使えたものではない
・ウィンドウモードにおいてマウスカーソルに移動域の制限がされない。そしてウィンドウ外に出たカーソルは非表示になる。そのためよくカーソルが行方不明になる",uLiang iDian u uE iDian u bsutorib Ju Ti De naWen Ti Dian noLie Ju toshiteha bshisutemuMian b Te niQi ninatsutaDian woGe Tiao Shu kideLie Ju suruto bosuniRuo Dian Shu Xing gaCun Zai sezuZhan Lue Xing gaXia matsuteiru

毫无打击感，后期打怪基本就是一边回蓝一边放杀伤最强的大招,把BOSS护盾磨完双击E放怒气技砍掉一般血，然后继续循环，对了，作为一个ARPG这游戏在后面还是需要适当躲躲BOSS大招的。

全成就没有难度，就两三个需要你稍微刷一下的（99级、累计100万金币、全技能，很抱歉我不想刷了）
剧情结构比较有趣，剧情到了中期基本就可以说结局了（毕竟相关CG的名字都变成了结局X不是?)，到游戏最后勇者们拯救了两次世界（游戏中的“现实”上和游戏中游戏的设定上）。
过了中期剧情感觉自己确实有点燃烧殆尽，剩下的主线的剧情觉得有点索然无味
日常剧情在本萌豚看起来还是挺有趣的，卖萌轻百个个不少某个著名网游轻小说也在本游戏里面中枪中成了筛子233，对于我来说，看那个小说在本游戏中中枪构成了我从这个游戏获得的40%的乐趣

我这个人比较实在，原画好看，我就给钱，还要给好评！

为了联机不卡我还特地搭了2个服务器啊！！强行自行优化啊有木有！！！

成就还是挺容易拿齐的，原画画的挺精致，剧情的重点依旧是她们在那里互相。。。。嗯，你懂得。其他的故事主线倒是可以忽略，反正是来看neta，听CV的嘛
[spoiler] 听CV们的娇喘，和看可以360度旋转的模型	[/spoiler]
开头的LOADING界面居然是个MP4视频！！！居然长达3分10秒！！

游吟诗人的第一首歌就是OST的第一首，也就是标题界面的音乐

[spoiler] 原来公会委托LV7给的武器才是可以升级4次的最终神器啊，不知道多少人被坑了呢2333	[/spoiler]

背水灵石的描述里面那个が，倒是が的肥而不腻，入口即化

不过联机任务的奖励都是随机的设定，感觉又是一个欧非之争的设定

不过这游戏的属性设定有点迷。首先，除了魔法和贝儿，其他人都没有自带属性攻击，因此为了输出最大化，属性攻击石头+15属伤是必带，然后，技能上说伤害与STR成正比，嗯，然后我去测试了一下，拿了个25%STR的石头，然后：提升居然有22.3%！你的正比怕不是真的就是K=1的正比例函数？？那直接无脑堆STR INT就完事了啊，属性石头+怒涛+自选STR最高的（减防御的和控血的石头收益大但是有风险），其他石头都是辣鸡啊。（我懒得换装，和我联机的小伙伴喜欢拿信仰灵石叠满觉醒然后拆了换怪力），因为觉醒状态的提升也才19%左右啊。你们设计的时候就不增加点收益系数和技能成长曲线的吗？觉醒时间延长2倍的石头在这个机制下都不那么重要了啊喂

绿灵心的捅捅捅强无敌，没有绿灵心单不死的BOSS，如果有，那就再来一个大。（但是为何我感觉绿灵心破防以后放魔法输出更高一点呢?），不过捅的时候不能强制中断闪避，所以打牛头的时候有点尴尬
白灵心，嗯，疯狂大风车就好了，竖着转接横着转（竖着转以后貌似有个后摇不能立刻接竖着转）4个里面STR最高，DEF最低的角色
紫灵心，看面板是最硬的，其他特点还在摸索中，感觉输出模式也是转圈圈
黑灵心，EMMMMMMM，这是信仰！（好吧实在找不出特点，也许平均就是特点吧。。所有属性都不是最高也不是最低）

在公会8之前一直主力输出都是优妮，许多人说空中平A就不会近身但是空中平A不像法师一样可以保持浮空会落地，所以感觉平A一轮以后LT向后闪避两下这样的输出模式DPS效率会更好些，嗯，当然后面出了乱射以后就没那么多事了。
前面的BOSS基本上都是靠优妮放风筝放死然后复活全体吃经验。。直到出了绿心
[spoiler] 优妮的这个越打越近的设定，配合着AI操作，那画面实在是太感人（全是0啊喂！）	[/spoiler]

鸡鸭其实很强，带 80 50 还有25属伤的石头，魔法伤害高的一比

诺瓦露高HIT带位移的连击技，加上本身就不低的DEF，注定这是一个外观+输出模式都挺OB的角色
[spoiler] 说好了炫酷的职业都是下水道呢！！！	[/spoiler]

布兰，EMMMMM，只要我的蓝条没空，BOSS你就别想让任何一个人倒下！

肝了几天，终于摸完了所有委托

1.不是回合制，像最终幻想零式一样，带着一个队，一个队4个人，零式是14个人，四女神OL是12个人，人物挂掉之后可以切换其他人但是你操作的人物没血之后会GAMEOVER强制回城，感觉像个不合理的设定（也许有意为之？）

2.玩过大概10分钟的多人模式，你只能控制一个角色，而且延迟很高。

3.全成就不难，只要稳着点打关卡都能摸过去。

4.想把所有角色属性值刷满可能要大战500h，非常符合日式游戏的一贯尿性。

5.AI傻，BUG多- -。。我通关的游戏也不少了，说真的，这个游戏是我玩过的游戏中恶性BUG最多的一个，没有之一，经常莫名其妙的卡主，放技能卡主放大招卡主被队友卡主被boss卡主卡在墙角卡在莫名其妙的任何地方，卡主之后必须回城，没有经验没有钱没有战利品。

6.剧情很轻松很搞笑，我很喜欢，比那些剧情强行喂屎，强行死主角，强行牛头人，强行悲剧骗眼泪的强多了。

7.价格比较低，虽说是地雷社骗钱跑路之作，但是价格还是很亲民的，希望地雷社不要跑路（#滑稽）

综上，见仁见智，bug太多了，自从发售以来一个补丁都没有放出来，可能是真的想圈钱跑路又不想挨骂把价格定的比较低。除去bug游戏还是挺有意思的，值的一玩（一边看剧情一边笑，nep实在太可爱了）

  不过，虽然吐槽了这么多，但进入游戏的第一张新手图给我的感觉还是非常不错的，无论是树木还是植被都比较赏心悦目。水面，天空，云朵，怪物以及特效还算是差强人意，不过地图外嘛...当然是很敷衍了，比如这棵十分敷衍直接上贴图的世界树：https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1352944955

  这次的十二个人物（四姐姐+四妹妹+四女神）个人感觉比之前的RB1-3和VII中都要好看，尤其是黑骑士版的诺瓦露以及黑灵心，我踏马上班！！！啥也别说了，黑灵心手办已买，真的是美哭啊我的妈！！！
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1353789306
  不过人物的建模感觉还不如以前，唯一的亮点大概就是换装了吧（其实我觉得那个换装系统挺zz的）

[h1] 剧情[/h1]
  海王星系列的剧情大家都很懂了，本作的主线剧情就是所谓的“被选中之人”收集神器召唤女神打倒魔王拯救世界的故事，主要亮点有：绅(bian)士(tai)妹控贝露本性暴露女神失格；布兰被数次反复提及身材，闻者泪(xiao)下(bao)；诺瓦露的没朋友梗和cosplay中二事迹大曝光（你没有朋友但是有老公啊！！！拖走）；以及茄子梗等就不说了，比较令人意外的就是疯狂NETA某刀剑了，可谓十分之丧病。如果你是老玩家，那么剧情还是十分有意思的，全程截图停不下来（大概有120+张），海王星豚大满足。

[h1] 优化[/h1]
  我都懒得吐槽这个了，最低配置比吃鸡还高，优化倒是半斤八两。本子配置i7-4720HQ+8G+GTX965M 2G+256G SSD*2，开头那个巨长的读取时间就不说了，第一次进的时候还以为卡住了，事实证明固态对这破玩意并没有帮助。进游戏后默认全高特效，然后...内存占用6G，显卡负载83%显存占用1.9G，直接30帧不到成幻灯片，调低两档特效后才能保持50+帧，时不时还会掉帧，可以说对霓虹程序员没有任何期待了（据说又是赶工的原因）。

[h1] 地图&音乐[/h1]
  天地良心，地雷社终于完全重置了地图以及大部分怪物（虽然还是有一个模型换个色改个名就出来充当新怪物的问题），而本作配乐也十分不错，这个豪华包买的不亏，不过OP不是nao姐唱的还是有点遗憾。

[h1] 游戏本身[/h1]
  游戏模式为ARPG，为了照顾玩家难度调的非常低，但是为了游玩体验，请务必使用手柄，APRG不同于回合制，鼠标调视角是会逼疯人的。游戏流程基本还是延续了以往接任务刷素材的模式，可能很快就会让人厌倦。值得好评的是本作全成就十分容易，不再有全员LV99这种纯凑数的成就，以及Lily rank这种智障设定（至今记得被U最后一个成就：十角色间Lilyrank LV10支配的恐惧），可谓全成就玩家福音。CG可以说也十分棒(๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧。值得一提的就是PC独占的繁体中文了，多少年了，PC党终于翻身了！

最后，只想说：[b] 四女神天下第一[/b]

Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online,schinese,"[h1]四女神的矛盾论(？)[/h1]
四女神ol[strike]在摸了大半年后[/strike]终于顺利登录pc平台，在忙绿了20+小时刷完全成就后放置了大半个月，回想起这个自己等了大半年的游戏，总想写点什么东西。这款个人所见游戏用一个词来形容就是“矛盾”。

[h1]操作间的矛盾[/h1]
因为海王星整个系列都是本质主机游戏，所有pc端游戏都是基本主机移植，也因此全系列的一个通病就是键盘操作反人类，强烈建议插上手柄以获得正常体验。插上手柄后也有视角移动和常规游戏相反的问题，需要一定时间去适应（我在全成就游戏后玩其他游戏的时候又花了半天时间去适应常规的视角移动）。虽然标题上写着四女神“online”，但是这还是一款单机刷刷刷的游戏，[strike]才不是标题欺诈[/strike]。虽然并不是真正的online游戏，但是可以进行联机游戏，有独立的任务可以进行联机游戏，但是因为没有独立的服务器，所以不要期待太多流畅的体验，个人还遇到过联机任务完成没有获得奖励素材的bug。游戏可供操作的角色（职业）有很多，乍一看的确是选择丰富，但是平衡性堪忧，[strike]单机要什么平衡性[/strike]，盗贼和魔法师强无敌，[spoiler]Nepgear：搓火球真TM开心，[/spoiler]某一两个职业太过强势会使得制作者设计的多职业变得很尴尬，玩家通常会选择让自己轻松游戏的职业角色进行游戏，而不是想把四女神ol完成黑魂ol。[spoiler]真有黑魂玩家当我没说。[/spoiler]其次，四女神ol在战斗方面也不像本传那种，完全摒弃了拖沓的回合制模式，即时战斗的模式让你感觉似乎真的在玩网游（笑）。


[h1]画面里的矛盾[/h1]
四女神ol在宣发阶段就宣布采用虚幻4引擎打造，让人对它的画面表现有了一点期待。但是真正游戏发行的时候，看到实际画面又让人产生虚幻4引擎是不是忽悠人的感觉。但打开游戏又确实看到了虚幻4引擎的过场动画，只能感叹一句至少比那些虚幻X引擎打造的页游强多了。不去和其他同样用虚幻4打造的3A游戏对比，单单和整个海王星系列去对比，四女神ol还是得益于虚幻4引擎的功力，画面水平已经处在系列顶端。海王星系列这代采用虚幻4应该是一次有益的尝试，虽然取得的成果差强人意，但是有革新的心态还是值得称赞的。[spoiler]就是不要像隔壁真38一样步子太大扯着蛋了。[/spoiler]



[h1]故事上的矛盾[/h1]
作为一款粉丝向的游戏，一般并不需要什么扣人心弦的故事，玩家们更注重的是角色的魅力，而角色的魅力已经在整个系列中被玩家所熟知，新作的任务不是塑造角色，只需要编织一些不冷不热的剧情去维护角色形象即可。四女神ol整体故事剧情上说不上有什么亮点，女神们参加四女神ol的内测，游戏出现黑客扰乱游戏秩序，女神们最后齐心协力解决问题。但是在这样模式化的剧情下，一些小细节倒是挺讨喜的。比如可以看到其他作品的neta（sao的桐人，nekopara的猫娘等），自己吐槽自己的绅士（胖次）视角，Vert和[strike]neptune[/strike]的红茶小讲座，（我居然在萌豚星里学红茶知识系列）。这类元素一直是海王星系列的特色，也是玩家所喜闻乐见的东西。

[h1]粉丝面的矛盾[/h1]
前面说了那么多，整个游戏给人的感觉还是浓浓的粉丝向游戏。但是问题是这一作因为做出的某些革新和改动反而可能引起了粉丝的不满，同时又因为这些革新的因素让这款游戏变得更容易让路人接受，（个人就是因为本传的回合制操作因而本传没玩多久，四女神ol刷的还挺愉悦），我的某些海王星系列粉朋友已经直呼海王星系列特典星，买特典送游戏，来调侃系列游戏的游戏性不强的问题。四女神ol通过一定程度的创新，使得游戏有了适应性的增强，因此个人感觉应该是目前最适合从未接触过该系列的玩家从这里入坑，感受一下这个系列的魅力。但是不可否认的是，四女神ol的整体质量依旧差强人意，可能有很多有趣的想法并没有完全在游戏中得到体现。千里之行始于足下，希望四女神ol这个不算完美的开始能带领海王星系列获得崭新的生命力。

Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online,tchinese,"[h1]無須輸入帳號密碼，以網路遊戲為主題的單機遊戲[/h1]

《4 Goddesses Online》（以下統稱《四女神 Online》）是款玩法跟網路遊戲毫無關聯性的動作角色扮演遊戲，從世界觀背景設定來看，本作依舊是喜聞樂見的外傳性質作品，沒玩過系列作或是對《戰機少女》這類作品不熟悉的玩家也能輕鬆瞭解劇情與遊玩方式。故事講述四女神與女神候補生們有幸被仍處於測試階段的網路遊戲《四女神 Online》邀請搶先體驗遊戲內容，而這款遊戲被設定成是【可被通關】富有主線任務路線的攻略型網遊，故以遊戲狂魔綠靈心貝兒為首的女神一行人決定攜手合作，結合眾人之力打倒最終頭目，但令人出乎意料的事情發生了，神祕的反派勢力崛起，贈與玩家被稱為【作弊程式】的輔助道具，破壞遊戲平衡的同時，也誓言要讓《四女神 Online》徹底垮台，永遠無法正式推出。 

前段已經提過《四女神 Online》在遊戲玩法上跟網路遊戲沒有任何關係，遊戲名稱指的 Online 打從一開始就不代表遊戲玩法，【戰機少女原作中的人物們玩著網路遊戲的單機遊戲】是筆者經過腦力激盪後，給予本作核心玩法的最好解釋。核心玩法幾乎百分之九十都是從公會接取任務，前往任務指定區域，討伐指定敵人或蒐集相關素材，最後再回到公會完成委託任務，這種透過完成委託持續推進故事劇情的作法在《戰機少女》系列屢見不鮮，幾乎可以說從最初版《戰機少女》遊戲到《四女神 Online》，玩法沒有一絲改變，頂多就是增加幾項看起來很新鮮，不過在實際操作遊玩過後很快就會感到厭倦的創意玩法，總而言之，如果你不是《戰機少女》系列粉絲，千萬不要對本作有任何期待。


[h1]畫面表現差強人意，沒妥善發揮 UE4 引擎效能[/h1]

作為系列作第一款使用《Unreal Engine 4》引擎的作品，《四女神 Online》似乎給予某些追求畫面精緻度的硬核玩家些許的期待感，光從遊戲預告很難看出遊戲畫面有無突破性的進步，直到進入遊戲開始遊玩後，玩家能清楚感覺到，本作無論是在人物建模、場景設計、甚至連技能發出的光影特效，都沒有《Unreal Engine 4》該有的水準，那還不如運用系列作曾使用過的《PhyreEngine》，先別管優化效能誰比較好，光是【免費引擎】這點就大獲全勝了！這也間接證明，把好的遊戲引擎交給不成熟的技術團隊操作，最終結果大多都是『畫虎不成反類犬』，失去了提供玩家高品質畫質的目的，無疑是拿著石頭狠砸自己的雙腳。


[h1]糟糕透頂的戰鬥系統，智商低落的 AI 隊友[/h1]

戰鬥系統仍然是《戰機少女》系列的硬傷，角色揮舞武器攻擊敵人時不僅沒有任何反饋效果，甚至在成功擊敗敵人後，玩家行進的路線和攻擊會被屍體擋住，偶爾還會發生死去的敵人【站得直挺挺硬是朝著你猛砍兩刀才倒下】的情況發生，筆者確定如此糟糕的設定絕對不是在致敬網路不佳導致的延遲現象，純粹就是技術層面問題，確實嚴重影響到遊戲體驗，玩起來躡手躡腳的操縱手感不是一款好的動作角色扮演遊戲該有的失誤。明明負責動作玩法的是曾製作過《閃亂神樂夏日對決》的 TAMSOFT ，本作在戰鬥的表現水準遠遠不及該作的十分之一，或許是因為《四女神 Online》實際定位是所謂的外傳小品，所以他們才沒有在戰鬥系統花費太多資金，可是不管擁有多正當的理由，戰鬥系統搞砸既是事實，遊戲體驗遭受負面影響也是事實，這是 IDEA FACTORY 不得不承認的失敗。

相較其他作品，本作的冒險隊伍人數雖然不多（十二人），但可以隨時隨地的更換隊伍成員，玩家最多可選擇四名角色加入隊伍，依照傳統網路遊戲鐵三角的配置，一個完善的隊伍分別需要傷害輸出、治療輔助、控場坦克，三種職業分工角色，看起來是不是很有網路遊戲小隊組成的感覺？然而你錯了，接下來會詳細說明給你聽。首先，遊戲前期在裝備尚未齊全，等級還沒達到一定水準前，治療者扮演非常重要的角色，因為 AI 隊友實在是太過於低能，看到任何敵人都是一股腦貼上去普攻，任由他們無腦衝鋒，你很快會看到隊友們一個個嬌喘倒下，看來 IDEA FACTORY 還是比較適合製作回合制戰鬥，畢竟身為玩家的我們能夠掌控整個戰局，不會讓按鍵精靈智商水平的 AI 隊友成為一無是處的敢死衝鋒隊。


[h1]有女神就買單，堅定不移的信仰讓本作得以生存[/h1]

《戰機少女》系列一直以來都沒有將遊戲畫面與玩法當作主要優勢，人物設定和各種無厘頭的搞笑劇情才是其精華所在，若以忠實粉絲的身分進行評論，《四女神 Online》探討的議題確實符合網路遊戲的主題，不管是再熟悉不過的網公網婆放閃、女性角色背後必定是猥瑣大叔的不可告人秘密、曾經一同攻略遊戲的陌生人卻是身邊親友、以及為了貪圖方便利用外掛破壞遊戲平衡被封鎖帳號等僅屬於網路遊戲玩家的種種回憶，都可以在遊戲中見到。或許本作在核心玩法部分差強人意，透過幽默手法完美重現的網路遊戲經歷，卻達到畫龍點睛且額外加分的良好效果，總體而言，筆者並不討厭這部作品帶來的氛圍。

整體來說，上述列舉出的缺點都是筆者的親身經歷，看到這裡相信大家應該明白《四女神 Online》不是一款依照大作規格製作的遊戲（儘管封面抹了一層外表看似光鮮亮麗的廉價水鑽），它是一款玩了會感到有趣的作品，不過當你細心去感受體驗，會發現其中的問題大到讓你開始懷疑人生，究竟是甚麼驅使你購買這款遊戲？是甚麼讓你能耐著性子在如此平庸的遊戲體驗下持續遊玩本作，甚至達到白金成就的進度？答案很簡單，就是【信仰】兩字，是粉絲們對四名女神的信仰，才讓《戰機少女》系列作得以在市場生存。


[h1]優缺點總整理[/h1]

優點：
+綠國子民大聲歡呼吧！戲分最多的角色是綠靈心貝兒和嚮導NPC布凱。
+支線劇情十分有趣，曾熱衷於攻略網路遊戲的玩家應該能夠引起共鳴。
+身為外傳性質作品，價格自然不會太高，頗適合新手玩家作為入門作。
+最後的優點是筆者個人私心，身穿司祭服的白國女神布蘭可愛過頭啦！


缺點：
-犯了動作遊戲的不該出現的錯誤，操縱手感不佳，無打擊感的戰鬥表現。
-身為一款提倡四人共同挑戰頭目的遊戲，隊伍同伴的AI智能卻十分低落。
-畫面水準比利用免費遊戲引擎製作的前作還糟，沒有發揮引擎原有性能。
-可有可無的糟糕多人連線模式，影薄到文章都要結束才想起有這項功能。


結論：推薦對《戰機少女》心存信仰之人購買 ，無信仰之人可迴避本作。

[b]游戏简介[/b]：《最终幻想15》[spoiler](FINAL FANTASY XV)[/spoiler]是一部由SQUARE ENIX制作并发行的日式经典动作角色扮演游戏，也是这个系列的第十五部正传作品。本作不仅采取了日式角色扮演游戏罕有的开放世界设计，同时也引入了全场景可无缝切入的即时战斗机制，讨喜的游戏设定再加上过硬的美术设计，相信没有人会对其说不——果不其然，本作一经发售就创下了该系列销量之最并一举夺得TGS日本游戏大赏优秀奖。

欲戴王冠，必承其重；欲握玫瑰，必承其伤。既然本作被承载了如此多的厚望，想必制作组也必须得拿出相对应的游戏质量来回馈。可惜事与愿违，这部被万众所瞩目的SQUARE ENIX年度巨制最终还是翻了车：呈现在各位眼前的仅仅是一部半成品，且后续完善剧情的部分DLC项目也被永久取消。话说到这份上，笔者却还是不得不承认虽然这部《最终幻想15》表现得并不尽如人意，但它在笔者心里依旧是一部值得花时间体验且不可多得的RPG佳作。

[b]游戏背景[/b]：【路希斯】与【尼弗尔海姆】两大帝国之间的战争旷日持久，无奈于尼弗尔海姆日愈强大的强大军事实力，即使是路希斯以皇室世代相传的水晶力量化为的魔法屏障也只是堪堪抵住，局势岌岌可危。就在路希斯王国节节败退即将被攻进王都之际，敌国宰相艾汀却孤身一人前往路希斯王都与其国王雷吉斯谈判讲和条件，要求割让除王都以外的所有土地并让王子诺克提斯与特涅布莱耶王国的公主露娜成婚以作和平见证，雷吉斯思索良久只得接受这不平等的停战协议。然而签署停战协议的当天，尼弗尔海姆突然与路希斯兵戈相见，哪怕路希斯旧屏障与王者之剑以死相搏，可依旧寡不敌众，路西斯王国一夕之间分崩瓦解。所幸雷吉斯早有预见，将诺克提斯与露娜都早早安排在了欧尔提榭相见，躲过了亡国劫。

身为路希斯王国最后的皇室血脉，诺克提斯需要在躲避敌国侦察的同时还得在世界各地寻找先王陵墓以获取王家武器增强自身实力，并和露娜弗蕾亚会合获取荣耀之戒；他不仅肩负着打倒敌国并光复路希斯的重任，更需要去完成专属于自己的神秘使命。

[b]内容设定[/b]：既然本作以开放世界作为卖点，那么游戏内地图的可探索性与游戏性则是重中之重。本作采用了动态昼夜与天气系统，昼夜时间会影响地图中强力怪物的出现频率与攻击欲望，恶劣天气还会暂时影响角色着装的显示效果。游戏地图包括了王国城镇与郊外山村，玩家可以自行选择步行、驾车、乘坐飞空艇或骑乘陆行鸟等交通方式来进行探索；且如此广阔的地图并不是单一的空与大，每个区域都会有对应的委托、狩猎任务可以接受，野外也分布了不少可收集的道具与矿脉；当夜间疲惫时还能在附近的露营地点驻扎并烹饪可口的食物来为主角一行人叠加属性BUFF。当然了，与其他同类型游戏一样，FF15也贴心地提供了诸如钓鱼等休闲放松的小游戏，有心程度堪比《巫师3》中的昆特牌：“露娜再等一等，这真的是最后一把钓鱼了！”

与老式日式RPG不同的是，本作还额外支持了全场景可无缝切入的即时战斗机制，玩家可以根据自身喜好来安排不同的战斗方式，战斗耗费的时间与歼灭方式则影响最终的结算评价。本作也是《最终幻想》系列的正统作品中首次放弃职业系统的首部作品，玩家再也不能像在系列前作中一样通过更改角色的职业而获得不同的战斗体验了。不过有失也有得，玩家操纵的主角不仅可以通过操控不同的武器并与不同的伙伴组成羁绊连技，还可以召唤幻影剑与召唤兽协助战斗，进一步增添了游戏趣味；与伙伴羁绊连技相对的是指挥与援助系统，玩家在战斗中也可以通过给周围的伙伴不同的战斗指令以完成各类华丽连招，当主角残血脱力时伙伴亦会主动提供掩护与援助。

[b]游戏总结[/b]：角色扮演类游戏的灵魂从来都不是精致细腻的美术亦或是华丽帅气的战斗，而是层次感丰富、能感人肺腑的剧情——FF15在前两个方面做到了极致却偏偏在剧情方面拉了跨。不论是游戏内各部分该填却未填的坑，还是最后俗套又空洞的结局，都极其差强人意，大部分只能依靠玩家自己通过查阅资料与观看系列电影等方式来完善游戏体验，悬而未决随即干脆放弃的DLC计划也算是彻底断了那些对官方仍怀有补全内容想法粉丝的念想。但是，但是！无论如何，本作依然是值得各位一玩的一部佳作。最终戛然而止的结局见仁见智，FF15在故事剧情的其他方面例如人物性格还是塑造的十分成功，再加上各类有趣的诸如副本挑战、宿营与钓鱼系统等内容设定，在游戏性上绝对是首屈一指；尽管目前还存在着这样或那样的遗憾，但它依旧是个好游戏，一直是，以后也是。

FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION,schinese,"[h1]开豪车+偶像组合人设+开放世界的《最终幻想》[/h1]
笔者作为从《FF2》开始入坑FF系列的老粉。FF系列每出一部作品，只要没有平台限制门槛，自己总会找机会尝试一下。不过《FF15》登陆Steam那会儿，自己却失去了对待以往FF系列作品的热情，且不谈被听说过不少玩家对于剧情删减的抱怨，以及看似有些跟风的开放世界。四个偶像造型大老爷们一起开着豪车出行的设定，让自己一度以为这次SE是要搞乙女向游戏的节奏，迟迟不愿开坑。隔了很久才开始尝试这部作品，然后发现实际上游戏我预想中的大相径庭。


[h1]混搭风的世界设定[/h1]
游戏世界设定方将古代风《最终幻想》（例如FF16、9、12） 与现代风《最终幻想》（例如FF7-8，FF10，FF13）进行了混搭，于是玩家在游戏中既可以看到威风凛凛的骑士团剑与魔法，也可以看到豪车，游艇，加油站，海岸度假都市。不过这种混搭风也并FF15独创，多年的《火影忍者》漫画中的所构建的世界亦是一个混搭风的世界。

[h1]不断动作游戏化的《最终幻想》[/h1]
从最早你打我一下我打你的的回合制，到《FF4》引入的ATB战斗系统再到与《FF12》引入的动态次元战斗系统，再到《FF7核心危机》的即时战斗模式。《最终幻想》系列的游玩玩家可以操作部分的的比重不断加强，有着开放世界加持《FF15》相比往期作品则再次进步了一大截。游戏的遇敌人机制不再是RPG游戏常见的踩地雷，或是碰上场景中游走的怪物切换到专门战斗场景的方式，而是玩家进入敌人的视线范围类，游戏中的一个区域会被红圈圈为战场。玩家则可以如同游玩动作游戏般操作主角通过平砍，闪避，格挡，背刺等动作与敌人作战，战斗应付不来是还可以通过指令调用队友的支援招式。 部分关卡中不时还来点开操作炮台，可破坏的油管，可破坏掩体。得益于质量不低的动作设计，战斗相比以往的作品爽快度要上升不少。出来战斗场景外探索部分也通过来点恐怖游戏般的Jupm scare桥段或者潜行要素来丰富游戏体验。在游戏的剧情DLC部分玩家更是能体验到在正篇动作要素基础上进一步强化连击要素的战斗系统以及《全境封锁》式的第三人称射击要素。


[h1]大幅改进的魔法与召唤兽系统[/h1]
本作中魔法以魔力球的形式成为了可以装备有使用次数的道具。玩家可以通过瞄准敌人后进行施放。通过魔法在地图上生成一大片伤害区域或者是用来引爆燃料罐之类的玩法还是非常有趣的，不过需要注意的是施放出的法术会对范围内的生物无论敌我进行无差别攻击。玩家在施法前还是尽量保障队友不会卷入其中。魔法获取的方式也比较有趣，玩家通过抽取地图上的魔法元素获得合成魔法的原料，在合成界面加入原料即可制作魔力球，填入的原料越多，魔力球的伤害也就越高，当高到一定数字时则可以生成高阶段法术。而投入不太原料还可以混合出有新效果的魔法。

作为系列自《FF3》出现并成立系列经典要素的召唤兽系统也有着较大幅度的变化。召唤兽的数量大幅减少，且它不再是以往那样可以随时施展出的主动魔法，而成了团队底牌版的被动支援技，当团队陷入危难之际，召唤兽则会以为毁天灭地版的华丽姿态出现给予对手众创，他们的出场次数虽相比以往的《最终幻想》作品来说要上上许多，但每次出场时演出效果与伤害力度都能让玩家为之一振。前不久Koei发行的《妖精的尾巴》中的“超魔法”的设定应该也对该系统有一定程度的借鉴。

[h1]丰富的可玩内容[/h1]
像怪物猎人般通过狩猎怪物赚取赏金；四处偷师给小队做出各种料理；架起相机到处拍照；拿鱼竿到海边钓鱼；到小店里玩怪物弹珠；乘坐陆行鸟来场追逐赛……同样得益于开放世界的设定，本作的可玩性应该也是历代以来最丰富的。


[h1]关于本作的角色[/h1]
虽然初次看到本作的四位主要角色时在角色造型一度有些接受不能，不过随着游戏的推进则会被角色逐渐丰满起来的性格而逐渐喜欢上这些角色。例如眼镜男伊格尼斯做得一手好料理，同时也是团队中的军师，在部分战斗开始前会给出战略上的有用建议；性格开朗的小黄毛普隆普特承担起来团队中吐槽与活跃气氛的要务，但当玩家了解到他悲惨的过去后会发现他的角色设计上有点克劳德的影子。有些叛逆的主角诺克提斯的侧脸多次让自己不由得想起了《火影》里的二柱子，不过他的十年后的造型的成熟和帅气在气场上可以与《FF8》的斯考尔有的一拼。


[h1]在游戏中甚至可以见到劳拉，日清拉面—有趣的联动要素[/h1]
本作的联动要素方面SE可谓是不遗余力，通过购买的CD专辑可以听到历代《最终幻想》的BGM名曲，在特殊地段进行拍照时会有劳拉之类的同社发行游戏角色作为彩蛋乱入。游戏中还有着日清拉面装备，《泰拉战争》特殊任务的相关联动。（早期的PS4版中甚至有着与《刺客信条》进行的限时联动任务，不过由于活动时间很久以前已经结束，如今的Steam玩家是无福消受了）


[h1]结语[/h1]
除去游戏中关于女主露娜删减式剧情处理部分不少玩家不满，游戏总体来说说还是亮点满满的。而19年3月在皇家版的基础上推出了帝国宰相亚丹的章节对游戏进行补充，让人不由得疑惑道先前被削减的露娜相关内容是否也会通过DLC补完的形式与玩家见面。不如留个念想吧，万一哪天实现了呢。",table tr th Huan Ying Guan Zhu  tr tr th Lai Zhe Li Zhao You Zhi You Xi Kai Hei Ri You Bai Piao uuShi Chang Qia  th tr tr th Jia Su steamShe Qu You Xi Ji De Yong uuE _z th tr

FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION,schinese,"剧情感人至深的开放世界日系角色扮演游戏。
整个评价基于 最终幻想15亚丹章完整版（FINAL FANTASY XV EPISODE ARDYN COMPLETE EDITION）

首先，我买这个游戏出于两点，著名的IP和优秀的画面，玩完之后我认为，这一部没有辜负我的期望，但是有代价的。

游戏开始于王国毁灭，王子开始踏上拯救国家的旅程。

游戏的本体部分，玩家的视线被完全局限在王子诺克提斯的视角，这也就是游戏早期被人诟病故事非常不完整的原因，很少有那么一款游戏，等玩家通关了都搞不懂这个故事到底是怎么一回事，FF15便是如此，直到结尾，我能感受到悲剧色彩，但是心头却掩盖不住整个剧本就仿佛为赋新词强说愁的搞笑感。
本体的支线任务就像是无底洞一样做不完，假如纯走主线是10小时，你需要花费至少额外的20小时去完成所有支线任务，而且这些支线任务的作用最多是带你了解了解这个开放世界，对剧情理解几乎没有任何帮助，是好是坏就仁者见仁智者见智了。
因此本体剧情就像是没有情感叙述平淡无奇的故事梗概。丰富的故事和情感在DLCs中得到了完整的补充，现在大包打折131块吧，说实话对我而言几个DLC加在一起就值这个价了。

DLCs的内容相较本体，无论是故事还是玩法都可以说是取精用宏，通过DLC内容，补充和加强了人物之间的情感，为整个剧情渲染了真正的悲剧色彩并揭示了剧情上沉重的宿命感。
通关完整版之后，我终于可以理解整个故事想表达的东西，可以说整个剧情就是悲剧的结合体，每个人都是自己悲剧的主角。

游戏的音乐无法否认的优秀，当我开始在故事中感受到真情实感的时候，我发觉BGM用的恰倒好处，当然比尼尔机械纪元比还差一点动人程度不够就是了。

就像我开头说的，凡事都是有代价的，感人至深的故事是耗费近三年并放弃了部分内容才能补充好的。
而画质，鄙人不财，我为了最高画质顶着平均40帧的游戏体验通关了，我期望的是CGI的画质，假如CGI是100分，最高画质的实机我给90分，虽然绚烂无比，但是游戏经常有有很明显的光影，模型和镜头抖动现象，如果是中画质我根本就不想碰这个游戏，太难看了。

最后是关于亚丹篇剧情里的选择，这也是游戏阉割的一部分，由于剧情过于迷惑我特意去查了一下，得到了大佬合理的解释在此分享出来: https://www.zhihu.com/question/317968903/answer/822905594  （说起来亚丹ARDYN确实叫艾汀比较音译，不知道为什么叫亚丹）链接放不出来,可以搜[spoiler] 为什么结局不管选反抗还是顺从结局都是顺从？难道就是想告诉我们命运无法违抗吗？ [/spoiler]

同时也感谢一个大佬的评测，指导了DLC的游玩顺序，顺带一提亚丹DLC适合13章结束后玩：https://steamcommunity.com/id/KwanYui/recommended/637650/

我的建议是，只玩主线用心感受剧情足以，我不想你和我一样放着10级的主线不玩，莫名奇妙打到了40级的支线。
无论是作为看客还是戏中人，这一切都像是一场梦，突然开始，又无疾而终，在平平无奇的时候闪耀，在感情正浓的时候抽离，即使发现追寻的终究是泡影，却仍愿为它肝脑涂地，最终玉石俱焚，幻想殆尽。",Ju Qing Gan Ren Zhi Shen De Kai Fang Shi Jie Ri Xi Jiao Se Ban Yan You Xi  Zheng Ge Ping Jie Ji Yu fantasy xv episode ardyn complete edition You Xi Kai Shi Yu Wang Guo Hui Mie Wang Zi Kai Shi Ta Shang Zheng Jiu Guo Jia De Lu Cheng  spoiler

FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION,schinese,"傻逼SE，你还我露娜还我露娜！

我对这个游戏的评价只有一句话：完美诠释何为金玉其外败絮其中。

差强人意的剧情：前8章跟后8章真的是一个人做的吗，撕裂感如此强烈的主线剧情我是第一次见。好在后半段剧情很优秀演出也足够煽情，让人能够忘掉前边的无聊，也让整个主线处于及格线之上

优秀的画面：最终幻想系列最好的画面，搭配上优秀的艺术设计，完美展现了这个幻想世界雄伟瑰丽，作为个旅游游戏FF15是绝对合格的。这里要特别称赞下食物的视觉表现，香味有种溢出屏幕的感觉。

音乐：这个没的说，SE的音乐从来没有让我失望过。

僵硬且空洞的开放世界：我一直以为，开放世界的灵魂在于玩家与世界的交互，这也是为何荒野之息能傲视群雄的原因。而在FF15这里，玩家不能爬山，不能下水，各种空气墙的限制让人索然无味。

令人战栗的支线任务：不停地去某个地方接任务去另外一个地方完成后再回来交任务重复N次，找狗牌找蔬菜找矿物找货物重复N次……大清早的起来清支线然后把我打得昏昏欲睡。

令人发指的技术力：上车黑屏，下车黑屏，对话npc黑屏，野外任务交互黑屏……你隔这玩大圣归来呢？还有各种bug闪退智障AI。汽车碰撞效果过于诡异，速度还巨慢，更多的时候我宁愿把他作为一个快捷商店和传送点。

战斗系统见仁见智：虽然不喜欢这个系统但是幻影剑真的很帅。

我是个相比于剧情我更偏向游戏性的人，从整体来说我不太喜欢这个游戏，通关主线剧情后也没有丝毫进入dlc的念头。
所以还是follow my heart给个不推荐，个人评分：6分

Secret of Mana,japanese,"全実績を解除したのでレビューをば
個人的な結論から言うと、思い出は思い出のままでよかったかなと
予約購入してプレイしましたが終わってみればなんだかなーって感じで

当時（SFC）もそんなに褒められた物ではなかったのですが当時は当時
音楽やグラフィックは素晴らしいがバグや戦闘面はそんな良いものではなかったです、が
リメイク版はその辺も少しは改善して出してくれたのかな？と期待してました
実際はグラフィックが可愛くなったくらいで後は特に変化無し

なんていうか戦闘面は少しくらい手を入れてほしかった・・・
武器スキルレベル上げるの面倒（特に後半）なのにチャージ攻撃の有効性ってあるの？
連続ヒットするわけでもないわ威力も変わってないよね？？　ね？
通常攻撃１００％以外の通常攻撃手段しか息してない、当時もそうだったような記憶
雑魚倒すのも段々とめんどくさくなってくる敵のダウン無敵時間、ハメれるっちゃそうなんだけど
相変わらず魔法使用時がヤバい、敵も味方もだけど
そのせいでボスがボスしてないのもがっかりで　え？　ってくらい弱い

他にも言いたい事はまだまだあるけど、これから買おうと思ってる人へ
私はお勧めはしません、昔をプレイした人もしてない人も
戦闘もアレですがシナリオや主人公のアレ具合、操作してないAIキャラのポンコツ具合
よっぽどポポイが好きでもなければやめておきましょう

[spoiler] 相変わらず音楽は満足です
最初のマンティスでハメ殺されるのがなくなっているのも良い
ボスが調整されまくって雑魚になってるのはどうなのよ
ラスボスなんて当時もそうだったけど棒立ちばっかし
もうちょっとその辺を調整してもよかったんでないですかね [/spoiler]",Quan Shi Ji woJie Chu shitanoderebiyuwoba ne Xiang Bian warazuMo Fa Shi Yong Shi gayabaiDi moWei Fang modakedo sonoseidebosugabosushitenainomogatsukaride e tsutekuraiRuo i spoiler Xiang Bian warazuYin Le haMan Zu desu rasubosunanteDang Shi mosoudatsutakedoBang Li chibatsukashi spoiler

海量僵尸来袭，你是否能守住自己的基地？作为一款娱乐rts游戏，上手难度并不是很高，毕竟你的对手只有僵尸。出生点很重要，考察地形资源分布是关键，剩下的就要看你的发展和堵路口意识了。本游戏优化不错，几千僵尸同屏依旧流畅；音乐也很符合末日的紧张感，科技树和兵种目前还不是很完善。地图的难度可调，但没有新手教程，目前地图种类较少，无联机内容。总的来说是一款对抗僵尸潮的佳作。JUST PLAY IT !",url play it

[h1]脚步不能太过停留，追逐你的人就在不远处[/h1]
也不知这些僵尸什么毛病，你刚建立个基地吧，就像是散发出强烈的荷尔蒙一样，大批量的僵尸都随味而来，这行为，像极了爱情●▽●，哎呀我都脸红了……咳咳，言归正传，僵尸，或者叫丧尸，这类的游戏在市面上出现过很多。但像这样以RTS形式来构建防御阵形的专门游戏，本作还是第一个，伴随着满屏僵尸的陪伴，一点也不感到孤独，幸福感满满的（笑）

[h1]僵尸的集体袭击？（×）求爱者的疯狂追逐（√）[/h1]
防御的构建，要根据每一张地图所给的任务，僵尸来袭的方位来决定。在每一关的开端，都会给玩家一定的时间来进行发育，毕竟发育成熟了，才好采摘果实嘛。周遭诸多的追随者总是会有着奇奇怪怪的礼物，把他们赶走，挖掘他们守护的矿脉与资源，拿走他们赠送的礼物，来填满自己的腰包，把自己基地发展的鼓鼓的，僵尸来袭，也就不怕啦。建造好基地，把士兵啊，狙击手啊，防御塔啊，都给自己周遭撸上，把自己包装成一个饱满的刺猬。由于每个关卡过关的要求都不大一样，所以如何构建也就要看每个玩家对游戏的理解来发挥。但如果一个不小心，你的某个G点被摸到变色了，那么恭喜你，更多的追逐者将从你的房屋之中出现来进攻你的内心，如果守护不好，那么少侠，请重新来过吧~·

[h1]英雄的存在，全TM是被抛弃用的[/h1]
在游戏的战役模式，有着这么几个关卡，玩家需要操作一个英雄来潜入基地，从中获取物资，货币，以及自己的任务物品（绝对不承认我是忘了任务物品叫啥）。但就这么一个英雄，该如何对面对那成堆的僵尸呢？英雄有2名可以选择，个人在这里只选择了女性英雄，但着实的被雷了一把，除了平撸，就没有任何其他技能了。在场景中，玩家可以获得各种各样的物资来进行补给，不过这物资也是少的可怜。你说既然那么重要的物品，为何不给咱们主角多派几个跟班呢？生怕英雄死不了么？据说男性角色还不错，玩战役的玩家可以优先考虑男英雄啦~·至于我嘛……都60%多了不舍得呀……

[h1]绝佳的体验，配合全图的mod，给你不一样的感受[/h1]
个人游玩游戏时，采用了某个玩家在3大妈发布的全图MOD，除了显示全图，就没有任何其他修改之处。但仅增加一个全图显示，让这款游戏的体验截然不同。不光是可以更好的规划整个地图布局，甚至周边那一大堆僵尸所有的位置以及守护的大宝贝你都可以看到。与未加mod相比，难度降低了不少，但对于新手来讲，却是更容易上手，思考。

[h1]总结来啦：[/h1]
看似难度很高的外表之下，玩家却可以依靠mod来实现降低游戏难度，适当的降低可以增加游戏乐趣，凡事不过头，乐趣就持续的久。只要你喜欢塔防，僵尸题材，RTS，均可以安逸的来享受本作，体验一把那种被亿万人追逐的赶脚。把本作当作守护好自己的心房，不被追逐着攻陷，也是一种独特的感觉，所以本篇就这么皮下来啦，请见谅(─.─|||。",table tr th Huan Ying Guan Zhu  tr tr th Lai Zhe Li Zhao You Zhi You Xi Kai Hei Ri You Bai Piao uuShi Chang Qia  th tr tr th Jia Su steamShe Qu You Xi Ji De Yong uuE _z th tr table

Slay the Spire,schinese,作为卡牌游戏，这是我所见过为数不多的、极具粘性和吸引力的其中一个。它的奖励机制既容易给人正面反馈又具有挑战性，动态组卡而非事先构筑的过程充满乐趣，同时也引导着玩家一步步深化对这个游戏的理解，四个英雄也是各有核心思路和以此为基础的几种组卡流派，每一局给人带来的都是不一样的体验。个人感觉战士和机器人的容错率是最高的，观者是一个需要通过状态切换来掌握节奏的英雄，用好了瞬间秒人也是不在话下，只有猎人比较苦逼，一旦抽不到关键卡和遗物输出又不够的情况下，就非常容易因为持久战而嗝屁。偏偏我猎人开局还经常脸黑，真的是太搞人心态了ORZ……,

My Time At Portia,schinese,"太肝了，就想一天接着一天，每天挖矿挖到睡着，不知道被谁扛回家睡觉的。主线的进度相对于其他元素的进度快太多了，我现在主线应该快没了，但好感度大多数人都一般般，等级也不够高导致技能才点了大概三分之一，钱也没到位，家里的地没买齐，房子也还没升满，感觉还要继续肝下去啊。还有一个博物馆的大坑。不过游戏后期的引导还是有点问题，后面的发电机和通电地板也没教怎么用，得自己去查查攻略了。战斗系统就比较随缘了，手感不好。

[h1][b]错过育碧的纪元，不妨试试这款卡通纪元[/b][/h1]
本评测来自于[b]小黑盒安利计划[/b]

[/code]

[h1]前言[/h1]

《Rise of Industry》中文译为工业崛起，是一款集成了策略与建造的模拟经营游戏。你在游戏中需要扮演 20 世纪初的实业家。在程序随机生成地图板块中不断发展，建设并且管理你日益增长的城市，让它不断发展并适应你的游戏风格。在游戏中你会看到许多游戏的影子，如城市天际线、纪元1800、物流大亨等等。游戏画风非常的卡通、画面也非常的简约让玩家游玩的时候感觉十分舒爽。

[h1]详细的新手教程为新手做一个良好开端[/h1]

　　一个模拟游戏的硬核与不硬核，取决条件之一就是游戏的教程，有的游戏新手教程极短，并且游玩的操作十分复杂，而《Rise of Industry》却将新手教程做到了极致，不仅除了多达53个步骤的新手教程为新手指点迷津以外，还出了一个Youtube的视频作为教学视频，只是稍微遗憾的是视频教程是需要玩家具有一定的外语能力。

　　游戏使用多键绑定统一操作，适应不同的玩家习性，比如玩家不仅可以使用WSAD来移动视角，还可以使用鼠标右键拖动实现视角移动、使用鼠标滑轮缩放视角或者使用PageUp、PageDown来缩放视角等等。

[h1]经典的模拟经营玩法，配合策略元素，打造属于自己的帝国[/h1]

　　游戏一开始会让玩家选择许多元素，比如地图大小、污染强度、资源、产品定价等等，进入游戏之后游戏会根据玩家所选的有所元素综合起来再根据程序随机生成岛屿。岛屿分为不同的区域，每个区域都有大小不等的城镇。点击城镇的名称可以看到这座城镇的零售商店以及他们想要的产品（工业产品、农业产品等等）。

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1734873351]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1734873351[/url]

　　玩家需要选择一个合适的城镇作为自己成为大亨的一个起点也是自己的一个落脚点。当然你随意放置总部也是无所谓的，但是一般情况为了避免自己在前中期竞争艰难，建议选择资源丰富以及资源匹配度高的地方作为落脚点更为合适。随着你的工业帝国的发展，你将不得不抵御来自其他大亨的竞争，迅速适应游戏的随机事件，并确保你不会因污染而扼杀地球。

　　在《Rise of Industry》中取得成功的一个重要部分是获取市场经济方向，并快速对其做出反应。弄清楚哪些产品需求量高，哪些城镇潜在的买家多以及他们愿意花多少钱，这是你成为工业大亨的基石。例如，一个看似不起眼的小镇想要玻璃，并愿意为此付出高昂的金钱作为交易。你抓住这个商机，要开始生产玻璃，但是制造玻璃你需要收集沙子和煤炭，因此建造矿山和采砂器是当下的首要任务。然后将这些材料通过卡车运送到制造玻璃的工厂，工厂制作完玻璃之后运送至一个仓库，类似于如今社会的京东物流一样，仓库作为分配点，将你的玻璃分配到各个城镇的商店，选择输送的主要城市，从而获取最高额的利润。这种经商竞争系统是本作最大的亮点，也是其他养老模拟经营游戏没有的，无论你的专长是贸易、生产、收集，还是任何才能的综合，你都会在本作中找到发展目标。游戏虽然看似卡通，但是暗藏着许多真实的场景模拟。城市天际线重在人民的管理（刁民满天飞），而工业崛起则是将经济可视化、真实化了，两者叙述真实的故事背景方向不同。

　　游戏还有一个最大的亮点就是科技树，游戏并不是前期直接就解锁所有的道具，而是需要玩家研究科技树，比如想走农业路线的玩家可以选择研究麦田，研究蔬菜园这些农业科技。而想走工业路线的玩家也有对应的科技研究，比如化学厂、造纸厂等等。这种玩法非常的写实拟真。

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1734882745]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1734882745[/url]

　　除去真实模拟以及科技树研究这类优点，本作还有一个可圈可点的优点，支持创意工坊。你可以制作mod或者是使用大佬们制作的mod来为你成为大亨的道路上锦上添花。

[h1]除去玩法让玩家赏心悦目，可爱的画风也让玩家心旷神怡[/h1]

　　本作给玩家是一种非常治愈的感觉，本作的画风不像其他的模拟游戏的画风走的是写实路线，而本作的画风走的是卡通风格的画风，让玩家看起来非常的可爱、舒爽。游戏的界面设计得非常清新脱俗，只有仅仅的上下两屏显示操作和数据浏览按钮，不像其他的模拟游戏把一堆工具栏布置在游戏界面的上下左右，感觉像是把游戏堵得水泄不通似的。

Desolate,schinese,"不要因为开头一个小时的无聊而放弃这个游戏，和朋友一起玩了将近30个小时表示这个游戏还不错。
主线剧情就不说了，后面还跟进了支线任务和日常任务（包括生物学家日常军需官日常等等）
随便主线的展开，合成系统逐步扩大。食品武器的制作种类也不少（蓝图需要自己摸索和在商人购买）
工作台炉灶的开启与升级，传送装置和复生仪的开启都需要慢慢捡垃圾来完成。
包括技能点系统，不同种类的药品对应不不同种类的伤害，时不时的恐怖闪现。喜欢这种类型的值得一玩。
目前来说服务器不算特别稳定，联机是没问题但也存在bug。
期待剧情继续更进吧，希望游戏越来越好。

"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus",schinese,"比我想象的要拉胯（虽说成就党全成就了）
这游戏主要的问题在于：
1. 诡异的事件选择
一般来说策略游戏中能让玩家做出选择的地方，都会明明确确的告诉玩家选择的后果是什么。比如战锤全战，就是各种奖励、惩罚和代价。再比如XCOM2，则是射击的命中率/黑客行动成功率，以及对应的奖励。这样玩家就能根据概率的多少和能负担的风险/回报做出对应的选择。
而这游戏不然，事件上每次都有三个选择，大致是莽，科学，虔诚这三种分支，但他不告诉玩家这些选项都有什么后果。结果就是要么背板或S/L，要么就听天由命。这在高难度基本上是致命的，毕竟你万一运气不好选中了敌方先手++，地图位置又不好的话，很容易一上来就被集火造成减员。这种完全不在控制内的减员极其增加挫败感。
2. 诡异的死灵族机制
这游戏的主要对手为死灵族，死灵族有个特别的机制，就是被击败之后不会立即死亡，而是会维持尸体状态一段时间，如果你一直不管的话会慢慢复原，而复原速度取决于警戒等级。所以完全杀死死灵族有两种方式，第一种是杀死之后补一枪，另一种则是暴击伤害。
但这个机制诡异就诡异在，你用一个伤害是1-2的小手枪暴击打出2伤害，能立即击杀死灵族。但当你使用各种超高伤害武器（8-10）的时候，不管你单次伤害有多高，只要不是暴击，死灵族永远都会留一个尸体在那儿开始复原。这其实降低了策略的深度和选择的自由度。
3. 并不鼓励探索
这游戏有一个地图机制叫死灵族觉醒度，随着觉醒度的升高，战斗中死灵族会获得一系列增强，而玩家则没有对应的增强。
死灵族觉醒度怎么累计呢？1. 每次进地图上一个新的点自动获得2点。2. 错误的事件选择。而减少觉醒的唯二的方法则是1. 摧毁战斗中出现的死灵族终端。2. 正确的错误选择（目测远远比错误的稀有）
但这其实有个问题，死灵族觉醒度的增长所带来的损害远高于可能的收益，因此除了背板或S/L之外，探索地图所带来的收益（黑石，地方先手降低，回血）根本无法抵消探索地图的风险。也就是说他们设计了各种各样的事件和文本，但他们却不想让你一一体验。这其实是挺诡异的设计的。

Heroes of Hammerwatch,schinese,"[quote] 加入[url=https://www.2p.com/#Steam]2P萤火虫[/url]，和我们一起用热爱点亮游戏之光[/quote]

[b]前言[/b]

这款游戏自18年正式发售以来一直持续更新，到现在为止已经两周年了，还发布了新的DLC月亮神殿，而我也是第一次玩这款游戏，游玩下来后感觉这款游戏更偏向于传统的roguelite模式。

[b]画面和音乐[/b]

本作采用了我个人比较喜欢的像素风格，让人有怀旧的感觉，但是游戏中的字体都是像素点组成的，这让人看起来有时候就很难受，游戏的音乐还不错配合这技能和各种怪物的音效，还是蛮带感的。

[b]剧情[/b]

对于roguelite游戏来说，一般剧情都很薄弱，本作也是如此，以至于长时间游玩过后我都忘记我到底为什么要下矿打怪了，这也导致了剧情仅仅只能作为游戏的点缀存在。

[b]游戏性[/b]

本作随机元素并不是特别多，主要体现在地图的结构随机，宝箱的随机掉落，以及矿车、水泉、商店等要素的随机出现，其他要素大多都是可控的。

游戏中最主要的资源就是矿石和金币，玩家通过游玩地牢收集。有能力轻松通关就直接通关带回，怕翻车就中途在有矿车的地图消耗一定的税金把资源运回城镇。城镇的建设需要大量的矿石，初期建议玩家主要解锁铁匠，然后是公会大厅，铁匠强化角色属性，公会大厅是角色加技能的地方，等玩家有额外资源的时候再去解锁其他建筑。一些有趣的建筑给游戏增加了不少乐趣，比如喷泉的增益效果和减益效果会让地牢内产生一定的变化，让每局游戏不至于都完全一样而索然无味。

职业方面一共有9个可供选择，其中角斗士和女巫猎人需要购买DLC才能解锁，每个职业各有特色，分别配置了主动被动各三个技能，由于单个职业的技能并不是特别丰富，如果只玩一个角色很容易会枯燥，然后游戏中就有了个公会系统，每个职业只要通关一次本体，就会获得一个让所有角色都享受到的属性加成。而根据通关的NG（游戏的难度）越高，加成也就越多，玩家如果想变强就必须什么职业都玩一遍，并且还要都玩的均衡，虽然有点强迫的意思，不过也让游戏不至于过快的进入无聊期。

难度方面，提升非常明显，NG0刚可以轻松过关的时候，直接去打NG1，感觉就像开荒一样，不过每通关一个NG会让角色的等级上限增加5级，慢慢提升总是能过的。话说回来，要说提升属性还是金字塔DLC里的雕像提升巨大，只要雕像等级够高，多少NG对于你来说都是小菜一碟，鉴于我没有那个DLC也就不深入说了。

[b]新DLC月亮神殿[/b]

月亮神殿增加了三个新关卡，加入了新敌人和BOSS，最大的变化是，地图被分割成一个个小房间，每个房间必须清理完所有敌人才能进入下一个小房间，这个变化玩家的反应是褒贬不一，对于我这样喜欢把所有角落都走一遍的人到是无所谓，对于喜欢快速跑图过关的玩家就很难受了。新增的三个BOSS我个人还是很喜欢的，有机制有特色，尤其是第三关的邪恶四法师打起来相当有趣。

月亮神殿还增加了一个雇佣兵模式，这个模式极具挑战，雇佣兵角色拥有建立就直接20级，初始25000金币，并且可以学习所有角色技能的优势，但是并不能通过公会获得其他角色的加成，也不能获得雕像的增益，不过还好可以受到城镇建筑的加成，一旦在地牢中死去，这个角色就会被删除。

[b]总结[/b]

这款游戏对于新人可以说非常不友好，如果只是自己玩，会消耗大量的时间在积攒资源上，在变强之前会一直徘徊在前几个关卡，非常消磨人的意志，如果不小心死在半路还没能运回资源，是非常容易心态炸裂的，而如果直接抱大佬的大腿，一直躺着拿资源的话，也会大大降低游戏的乐趣，所以要怎么选择就看玩家自己了。

铁锤守卫英雄传这游戏两年了，每天依然可以看到游戏中有不少联机的房间，这也说明本作还是有他的独到之处的，我也很推荐喜欢联机的小伙伴一起来玩。

Heroes of Hammerwatch,schinese,"游戏很好玩，很好玩，但是，但是，太TM肝了，而且难度也不小。
以我这种手残为例，一般玩一晚上可能就只能在一个大地图区域瞎晃。而且BOSS也挺难的。
总之这种肝，一部分是因为要素比较多，但另一部分完全是因为数据成长缓慢。（需要不断刷矿和钱）
4个人输出高了可能会简单点，1个人玩久了就会想——
我要是有个双倍甚至10倍经验/钱/矿加成的BUFF该多好[spoiler]（以至于这游戏创意工坊热门MOD第一位就是个修改器，看来跟我想法一样的应该不少）[/spoiler]

这里就不得不提一嘴，这游戏的路数一开始应该是趁着当时的roguelike类（或者说roguelite？）游戏热出来的，但越玩我越觉得它其实更像也更适合暗黑破坏神那样的无脑刷刷刷模式，虽然有捷径但比正常打关卡难，所以死亡惩罚和随机装备带来的乐趣全部淹没在重复通关或者重复没法通关之前关卡的痛苦之中，再加上肝就有点无趣了。

我觉得在现在这个快餐游戏盛行的年代，作者完全可以从数据上，或者干脆抛弃ROGUELIKE部分，把游戏改的不那么困难和肝。因为游戏内容确实非常丰富了。做成无脑刷刷刷都可以玩好久，但现在的话，要体验新内容或者说下一阶段的内容，你必须在上一阶段“肝”一会儿才能更进一步，失误？重来。这无疑会劝退很多人。


作为一个一次付费的单机，这点的平衡做的并不好。毕竟好玩的游戏太多了。

不过在游戏内容上 还是打个大好评的，装备和技能升级这类都有的不谈。还有
“冒险公会-角色”这种模式，各种帮助角色成长的建筑，而2个资源系统其实恰到好处
有任务能开不同的角色和建筑，
而且每一关都有不同风格的想法和解密和还能和BOSS战契合（[spoiler] ]图书馆解密找去下一层的小按钮还是挺蛋疼的[/spoiler]）
但总之还是太肝了，他需要你花费太多精力和时间才能享受到游戏的精华，其实改简单点说不定玩的人更多。",You Xi Hen Hao Wan Hen Hao Wan Dan Shi Dan Shi Tai tmGan Liao Er Qie Nan Du Ye Bu Xiao  Bu Guo Zai You Xi Nei Rong Shang  Huan Shi Da Ge Da Hao Ping De Zhuang Bei He Ji Neng Sheng Ji Zhe Lei Du You De Bu Tan Huan You  You Ren Wu Neng Kai Bu Tong De Jiao Se He Jian Zhu

Heroes of Hammerwatch,schinese,"大家好，从今天开始，我会不定期的、随心随性的给大家推荐一些游戏，今天我推荐的游戏名称是：Heroes of Hammerwatch，中文名：一锤砸瘪英雄
这是一款上帝视角的RPG-ACT-Roguelite游戏，简称RAR游戏，嗯嗯。
这个游戏加上DLC，目前一共有7位不同职业的小伙伴，在半随机的地下城中冒险、捡垃圾、升级、吹遍被boss用铁锤砸瘪
除此之外，作为Roguelite元素，地城冒险之余，我们会用捡垃圾积攒的金币建设城镇，目前可以开设赌场、吸毒所、妓院……呃……
抛开经营元素不说，这是一款非常好玩的动作角色扮演地城冒险游戏，有点像暗黑大伯伯，各职业区别明显，每个职业都可以升级、养成，并且每个职业推进游戏后，都会对其他角色提供一些帮助，比如属性点的增加、技能点的增加、金币的增加等等
而城中的各种场所，又为地城冒险提供了很多增益，永久buff按下不表，光是随机状态、各种机制也很值得一玩，比如可以通过将主角的血量上限减为一滴，换取经验、金币的增加等等。
虽然我的介绍有些凌乱，不知道大家看完之后会不会有兴趣进入游戏页面，一览究竟呢？
=============
这个游戏出奇的好玩，属于有一定角色养成性的roguelite，很对胃口。
几种职业各有千秋，系统也很不错，后续dlc也很有诚意，希望dlc再加把劲，争取一个季度一个dlc，搞他三五十个职业和新地图！",hammerwatchZhong Wen Ming Yi Chui Za Pie Ying Xiong

To put it short: Crackshell did it again, but this time with randomization.

Heroes of Hammerwatch is a ton of fun to play, especially with friends. The difficulty is pretty constant for a rogue-lite and there's a lot of things to find in the semi-random dungeons.
The game can be a bit grindy at times, especially when playing solo. It's definitely best in a group but it's pretty fun alone as well.

《SENRAN KAGURA Peach Beach Splash（闪乱神乐：沙滩戏水）》是闪乱神乐系列最贴合绅士老爷心思而设计的作品。盛夏、美女、泳装、湿身、射击，大量让人心动的福利元素，Tamsoft全都努力放了进去。超过30名角色的盛大登场，上百件不同泳装的华丽演出，比起一般的FPS游戏，这部作品就像是盛开在夏日最光彩的一场盛世嘉年华！

[h1] 我本来想拒绝的，可实在是太大了！ [/h1]
首先说说为什么想拒绝，XSEED旗下现在已经推出了多部作品，而且凡出必大卖，不过有两部作品非常特殊，一部是当家招牌、系列首作：《闪乱神乐：少女们的抉择》，还有一部就是这个：《SENRAN KAGURA Peach Beach Splash（闪乱神乐：沙滩戏水）》了。可以看出来，无论是制作组还是发行商，一直都把这两部作品当作自己接客的头牌娇花，放在神龛里面供着，放在千花水里养着。

为什么这么说，以前有个段子是这样讲的，怎样看一个作品，特别是妹子多的作品，是不是游戏场的亲闺女？当然看皮肤啦！无论是LOL里面拉克丝，还是超电磁炮里面的泪子，亦或是型月社的吾王，管他三七二十一，亲女儿绝对是最舍得买……啊不对，设计新衣服的。请还没入坑的观众老爷们点开《闪乱神乐：少女们的抉择》和《SENRAN KAGURA Peach Beach Splash（闪乱神乐：沙滩戏水）》的商店页面，往下拉，看DLC。

看出什么东西没，眼睛花不花，DLC多不多，衣服炫不炫，肾疼不疼？嗯……那就对了。不过我还是要说一句额外的话，这点必须让不知情的玩家老爷知道。关于这两部作品的DLC，能看出发行商在对待这两个亲闺女上面的一个营销反套路（因为是亲闺女，所以舍不得嫁吗？泪崩……）。两部作品的诸多DLC，其实是在发布最开始两周免费送给已购买玩家的。没错，好几百大洋的内容，曾经通通免费送！

不对啊，不是常说：早买早享受，晚买享折扣，不买等着送吗？对，一般公司确实是这样，某些个大厂尤其典型（别缩脑袋，育碧说的就是你！），但是这家公司，为了自家亲女儿也是够拼的。人家直接就是：早买早享受，早买享折扣，早买还有买费送！所以，真有意入坑本系列的玩家老爷，在此善意提醒一句，这两部作品如果你们真的打算买，赶紧等到好的折扣就赶紧下单。不买的话，不知道下次又送什么免费好看的小东西，到时候真要后悔的妈妈都不认识。

不过，即便是像上文中提的那样，有DLC的这个问题。可是，本来想拒绝的我，最后还是忍不住……非要说原因。别……别指我，撅你手指头信不信，又……又不是我守不住的，是……是我弟弟啊！弟弟告诉我说，这款作品……实，实在是太大了！

[h1] 谈谈姐姐们，引申到这个妹妹降生！ [/h1]
整个系列首部作品《闪乱神乐：少女们的真影》于2011年发售，当时还是一款横向卷轴的动作游戏，其中插入了大量剧情对话与有声小说。一年后《闪乱神乐 Burst 红莲的少女们》同样在大量玩家的期盼中上市。后面的这款游戏，不仅收录了前作的全部内容，还追加了专门讲述恶忍故事的“蛇女篇”。另一方面，为了增加观感，并提升人物可塑性，把部分“坏人”逐渐洗白。

2013年，系列大火的《闪乱神乐 Shinovi Versus 少女们的证明》发售。这款新游戏一改前作的横向动作，而成为了杂兵战类似《真·三国无双》、而Boss战类似《火影忍者：究极忍者风暴》的割草+激斗游戏风格。此后的《闪乱神乐·真红》和2015年的《闪乱神乐 Estival Versus 少女们的抉择》，因为前辈作品在业内成功大红大紫，都沿袭了这种战斗设计。不过就在前辈们都在割草这条路上准备走到黑，壮士一去兮不复还时，制作方一反常态地做出新的尝试。于是我们最后就见到了这部《SENRAN KAGURA Peach Beach Splash（闪乱神乐：沙滩戏水）》。

本作诞生后，很多细节我就不意义赘述了，不过要问我，有没有那方面的补丁……别看我，我不懂，不知道！我相信不是没有，甚至都做了，只是作为热度大火的作品，想卖的好又要过审，也不像I社那样凭借自己在黄油界独占鳌头，所以结果就是，都没放出来……不过，作为大名鼎鼎的闪（奶）乱神乐，故事真的有这么简单？必然不可能的呀。这款游戏，简直处处都是社保内容，甚至可以说，就是为了社保而生的。

操作方面的细则，我就不在这啰嗦了，本身不复杂，而且评论区大佬们说的也够多了。所以我就在这简单分析分析，力求一两段话把核心说到灵魂深处。本作的操作，作为FPS，整体是很合格的。较好的操作手感和便捷的按键，让入坑的人好理解，门槛也降低了很多。游戏中自带了十多种武器，功能也不尽相同，甚至可以说完美满足了不同武器取向的玩家老爷的需要。不同的武器种类，不同的弹药威力，不同的弹道和射程，构建了一套看起来有点虚，其实特别硬核的战斗系统。

另外值得一提的是，由于游戏里取消了前作复杂的忍术系统，所以也做出了改动。这个取消，也不是无脑取消，取而代之，加入了一种符卡系统，通过特殊的卡片，相当于消耗性的技能，在FPS对战中打出不一样的战术配合。另外，游戏里面可以腾飞升空。但是有一点操作比较蹩脚的地方在于，子弹消耗和腾空消耗，是同一个能量槽。这点设计其实有点不科学，因为这款游戏上弹很慢，在上弹空档期，人物相当于同时丧失了机动力和攻击力，完全无法保证生存，这点设计，可以说本质上是降低了玩家体验的。

不过总的来说，作为在FPS方面毫无经验的闪乱神乐制作组，在本作还是非常优秀地设计出了一套战斗系统，而且没有出现什么错根断骨类的问题，非常不容易，也使得这部作品的质量，得到了非常稳健的保证。无论如何，我们该给他们的辛苦付出点个赞。

[h1] 没有黄油，可就是为社保而生的！ [/h1]
作为如此羞耻系列作品的花旦小妹，又诞生在夏日泳池这样一个更加让人羞耻的背景下。即便是我们不说，制作组不搓破，也明显要嘿嘿嘿的好吗？结果证明，这个小妹非但没有让我们失望，而且比起前面那些大胆的姐姐们，在尺度上真的是各种有过之而无不及。这胆子也太肥了，过……过审小公主吗？

首先，要提到一个被绅士老爷们津津乐道的处决系统，这个必须最先说！当游戏中敌方的生命值减到最低，而且也不再有备用生命槽的时候，这个系统就能非常应景地被触发。这个处决，可不是普通的处决，简直是堵上小姐姐羞耻心的神来一笔啊！玩家可以用手中的鸭（弟）子（弟），肆意地喷身体不同部位，带来的反馈和呼（呻）救（吟）声更是令人遭不住。再看看那里面喷出来的是什么东西吗，黏乎乎的，湿哒哒的。液体溅射到不同的部位，还会相应伴随不同暴击分数，虽然小姐姐有圣光护体，但是讲道理，剩一点儿，难道不比看光了更迷人吗，我居然第一次没觉得圣光很讨厌。

其次，游戏过程中的细节，简直也是努力向着绅士老爷们的弟弟靠拢！比如说，过场动画动不动就不小心解开的系带，简直了让人瞬间想要开冲。再比如说，换个子弹不能好好换吗，那个姿势，那个动作。妹子啊！你赶紧放开那可怜的枪管，让我……哦不，我的弟弟来！至于子弹射到胸前的“球”和腰后的“球”产生超出色的反馈效果，那就更加让人欲罢不能了。为什么这么顶，据悉，其实是由于制作组在制作前，就参考了数十种果冻布丁、高合成橡胶的触感和弹性，不断进行3D建模的实操模拟。我……制作组你们这群大！变！态！……态……态……给我再来一打好不好？

至于更衣室，我就更不必说了，那是怎样的圣地，那么多玩家老爷们想要看到的盛世美景，不都在那里吗？额外还要说到的，是游戏中各种神级的台词。姑娘们，你们说这种话真的好吗？再……再多说几句吧，我爱听……什么“想吃又粗又大的棒棒”，还有“刚好是可以入口的尺寸”，以及“好想拒绝，可是身体不知道该怎么办”，甚至是……算了不说了，还想听的话，愣着干什么，赶紧买游戏！

[h1] 综合评价 [/h1]
✔优点：
1、作为FPS，武器系统和战斗系统都较为科学，可玩性强，实战性高。
2、作为社保，拔作级别的发挥，全是擦边球，却足够成为弟弟乱葬岗。
3、推陈出新，敢于打破系列割草的传统，推出射击元素，有趣新颖。

✘缺点：
1、子弹和腾空系统的共能量槽，导致游戏玩起来有点卡手。
2、单人玩到后期容易因重复而无聊，但多人服务器又不太好，希望后期能改善。

SENRAN KAGURA Peach Beach Splash,schinese,"这个好评写下，我跟奶子闪就算两清了，下作也不会有情怀加成了。
总的来说，如果没有那一大堆打了九折还一千多的dlc，我给的总体评价是6（+3）的评分——其中6分是本体游玩后的整体体验分，另外3分加成则是情怀加分；但算上dlc的话，我只能打下5（+0）的评分。
这其中不只是因为这令人头皮发麻的价格，还因为另一个原因，且等我细细道来：
————————
本体游戏评测：
用一句话来说，100多买这个游戏并不吃亏，甚至还有些小赚。
奶闪的一贯的传统、并且本作更是强化了的更衣室系统不用说，这作的游戏设计上也是下过功夫的。虽然表面上是用少女互射.avi来吸引眼球，但你实际操作进去，就发现这不光是一个垃圾小工作室做出来的噱头，除却养眼之外，更兼顾了游戏性。
这也是为何奶闪系列人气一直不错的原因，它的表层或许是卖肉，但深层颇具匠心的游戏设计，像我这类在一阵颤抖后脱离了更衣室低级趣味的玩家，也能够把这个游戏玩下去，这是其他很多卖肉游戏比不了的。
话归正传，本作的游戏系统很简单，就是女孩们拿着水枪互射。但是单纯拿水枪来回呲自然没太大意思，于是游戏中引出了另外许多附加的系统——水枪的种类、装填系统、机动系统、湿透时间、血量保护、以及本作最核心的系统——卡牌系的技能卡系统。
不错，本作看似表面上是玩TPS，可实际上黏人的却是近几年来火爆不衰令人牙疼的系统，卡牌。
不过讲卡牌之前，我得先简介一下本作的战斗模式，以及上面提到的那些系统，这样大家才能明白卡牌的重要性。
首先是武器系统，本作水枪也按照大多数射击游戏的武器设计，分为了散弹、手枪、狙击、rpg等等武器，并设计了相应的射程、射速、耗水（弹）量等等系数，以及每种枪械拥有两种不同的射击模式，大大增加了花样，不过因为本作几乎全屏的自瞄，枪械上手都不难，没什么好说的。
而本作并没有人物面板，人物面板的属性只有血量一个，没有什么特化（所以本作的人物基本等于皮肤）。那么人物属性是什么？那自然就是武器属性本身了。
武器属性的面板有射速、攻击力、耗弹量、射程这些东西，但是隐性属性还有影响人物的机动性，武器属性引申带来的作战模式的不同等等潜在问题。可以说武器本身属性，就是人物面板。
机动系统则有两种模式，一种是通过喷射消耗水量来在地面滑行快速移动的水冲刺，一种是长按跳跃喷水以达到升空飞行目的的水跳跃，可以说这两种机动操作让普通的水枪互射，变成了真正的神仙大战，如果你在游戏里失去了机动性，基本也就离死不远了。
而前两者的核心，就是装填系统，也就是水量槽。武器的弹药是水量，机动消耗的同样是水，可以说这个槽就是我们寻常概念的法力槽（西幻系）或者体力槽（动作系），是我们除了血槽以外最重要的一个指标。
水槽的消耗很快，基本上就是数秒就需要重新装填，只要一直按R，水槽就会开始恢复装填，这个装填的速度取决于你选择的武器，另一方面，装填的时候也是你最脆弱的时候，因此你需要保持高机动性，让你在装弹时保持移动不要被打（比如在落下时空中装弹）。
所以话说回来，这三个系统终究是相辅相成的，武器影响了装弹效率以及机动速度（比如加特林和火箭机动就比手枪差很多），机动速度决定了你的生存能力，而装填则保证了你的续航能力，这三者相辅相成。你可以选择均衡发展，也可以选择偏向极端，可以说这个系统的设计上麻雀虽小五脏俱全，是用了心的。
当然，光是这样也免不了偏科，追根究底武器本身就决定了作战模式，很容易被人搞透，PVE、PVP谁强谁弱不用一天就能摸清。因此游戏又催生出了湿透时间与血量保护。
湿透时间是指敌人或队友的水枪命中时会累积的一个槽，攒满之后就会获得无限水量以及威力加强，可以说补足了一些需要常需要上弹的武器的弱势（比如狙击枪和rpg）；而血量保护则是在半血时强制触发获得无敌护盾的一个保护性措施，避免被某些武器瞬杀（加特林）。
虽然加了这两个设置，但实际上并无卵用，依旧逃不出套路，于是真正能够将玩法多样化的就只剩下了一个，卡牌系统。
卡牌相当于技能，一次战斗能够携带三张伴魔卡（召唤后持续出现，在持续时间到达前/失效前不可召唤第二只），以及六张技能卡（使用立即生效，可连续使用），虽然伴魔卡一共就十多张，但功效都很强劲，技能卡就更多讲究了，一共三十多种类的卡片，涵盖了各式各样的攻击与辅助技能，可以说一下子就让整个系统变得复杂起来。
而在进入战斗中后，手中就有九张卡中的随机三张（至少一张伴魔），使用后会随机出现另一张，可以说是将战斗变得更加不确定性与多样化。很有可能上一秒你还在弱势，但是正好抽到一张急需的卡片，便能一转攻势。
而技能卡的使用则需要费用；这是当然的，卡牌游戏都这个吊样；奶闪PBS里需要的费用很简单，就是随时间补给的，所以这给一些攻击不够的放风筝流又有了很大便利，让战斗变得更加不可预测。
或者换句话说，这个游戏本来就是玩卡的，而且是比较新鲜的玩卡方式。
那么问题来了，为什么我上面说的天花烂坠，但我给的基础分只有6分呢？
这就涉及到了另外一个问题了，那就是花样虽然多，但真正有效的却不多。甚至于以上种种手段也不能避免套路僵硬化。
例如对游戏中的NPC，NPC通常都很蠢，但人多血量却又奇厚无比，能奏效的武器只有火箭筒和加特林。其它要不是输出不够，就是灭敌效率极低！而这两者的缺点都很明显，因此技能配置可想而知。
而对pvp来说，半血保护和机动性这种东西就成了很恶心的东西，玩家pvp自然会选择威力更大更好用的武器，而不是突击步枪之类的垃圾，因此pvp经常见到的配置就是拿着榴弹、rpg（模式2导弹自动追踪，打击范围大）和狙击（配合攻击上升buff可300血秒人）的猴子满天飞。拿的技能也就那么几个，其中最核心的一种就是妨碍装填——应了我上文那句，没水就离死不远了。
除了套路同质化极其严重外，这游戏还有繁多的缺点。
比如使用技能后会重置镜头到视角正前方；
比如无论正负面的技能buf均f无法叠加，导致正面buff可以被敌方的debuff消除，但旋即又被自己的buff顶掉；
比如被小怪包围后无限凌辱不能还手的尴尬情况（只能等到半血无敌或者交命）；
比如这亮点寥寥的剧情，少到令人窒息的人物刻画，以及照比前作被大幅删减的个人线剧情；
比如各种剧情开新章跳出、联机跳出的恶性bug；
比如过于难肝的喂卡材料；
比如照比前作差了太多的平淡配乐；
比如卡牌大量使用前作cg抠图，且本作那略显寒掺的cg数量……等等。
虽说如此，前几作的旧作人物的登场还是让人高兴，因此我又给出了3分的情怀加分。
总体而言，如果是第一次接触闪乱神乐系列的新玩家，不必被这些dlc吓住脚步，至少以本体的素质来说，它完全对得起自己的价钱，已经是steam游戏中性价比比较高的那一档了；
而对老玩家来说，我不说什么你们也懂得。
————————
DLC问题：
说实话，第一次看到加在一起一千多的DLC，我内心不只是拒绝的，甚至还想骂人。
当时我第一个念头是直接退款，并且的确这么做了，后来想了一想，这作人物顶多就是个皮肤，那些衣服大不了不看，硬盘里的几百g不比这有意思，我不玩更衣室就好了，强行自我安慰一番，我最终把退款取消了，开始下载游戏。
一开始我没觉得有什么不对的，玩的也挺好的。直到后来我下了盗版，看到了那些dlc的内容后，我生气了。
问题不在于那些皮肤和垃圾衣服首饰，而在于我完全没想到的东西——
附赠卡包！
你们以为dlc附赠的卡包是普通卡？那就错了，这dlc卡包的卡是闪星卡，是属于821张卡之外的付费内容，换句话说就是氪金道具。当然这也不是让我生气的地方，让我生气的地方，则是这些卡有点强过头了！
这些四五星的闪星氪金卡简直不讲道理，攻击卡的攻击加强，比如普通的五星雪泉卡是诱导追踪弹，可五闪星的雪泉卡就是三连诱导弹！绯雅的黑洞攻击力高了一小半！辅助卡更是效果加强，同等级下效果却比普通卡高出10%左右。
还有最重要的，就是这些卡的费用统统比普通五星卡减少一半！
例如五星雪泉和五星绯雅是2费，而加强版的技能却只要1费！又比如辅助卡因为费用减免，导致许多四星氪金闪卡甚至秒杀了五星卡！我从来没见过这么破坏平衡的氪金卡！
就连我谷歌上查到的日文wiki，都写着如果pvp，最好买这些dlc卡强化战斗力！我是真的被恶心到了。
我就不说既然有pvp模式为什么还要出这么破坏平衡的dlc卡了，就是正常的游戏，最强装备也都是可以在游戏中努努力获得的吧？怎么到你这里还必须要买dlc了？我tm玩的是屠龙宝刀一秒刷爆的垃圾游戏，还是单机游戏？
现在很多网游都不敢直接卖顶级装备了，连垃圾TX都知道含蓄，怎么我玩一个单机还会碰到这种破事？
哪怕是黑魂dlc地图掉高级装备，人家dlc也是有内容的，装备顶多是一部分，你这个dlc就是直晃晃的卖顶级卡，是不是有点过分了？
我算了一下，光是买齐所有包含卡包的dlc要465（含首发折扣），这可以说是半强制性的消费了，而如果你是个人物皮肤党，你还需要花246（+23，如果你没有nep的dlc，已计算折扣），一共就是700多块。既然如此，那300也不差了！
我原以为dlc可买可不买，但实际上不是，光是几个包含卡包的dlc，就已经不是爱买不买的问题了，说句不好听的，这就是滥用dlc捞钱。
而且这如此令人窒息的定价……对不起，原本积累的好感已经清零，望奶闪系列好自为之。哪怕是奶粉也不是这么圈钱的，做的太过了！",Ben Ti You Xi Ping Ce  Chu Liao Tao Lu Tong Zhi Hua Ji Qi Yan Zhong Wai Zhe You Xi Huan You Fan Duo De Que Dian  Bi Ru Shi Yong Ji Neng Hou Hui Zhong Zhi Jing Tou Dao Shi Jiao Zheng Qian Fang  Bi Ru Ge Chong Ju Qing Kai Xin Zhang Tiao Chu Lian Ji Tiao Chu De E Xing bug Bi Ru Guo Yu Nan Gan De Wei Qia Cai Liao  Bi Ru Zhao Bi Qian Zuo Chai Liao Tai Duo De Ping Dan Pei Le  Er Dui Lao Wan Jia Lai Shuo Wo Bu Shuo Shi Yao Ni Men Ye Dong De  dlcWen Ti  Fu Zeng Qia Bao

SENRAN KAGURA Peach Beach Splash,tchinese,"[h1]妹子 X 胸部 X 水槍大戰[/h1]
時隔快半年後從原本的負評重新評價。

[h1]開發者更新[/h1]

在這段時間內，開發者已經修正了不少問題，就連鍵位顯示也做了修正。雖然[b][u]系統層級[/u][/b]的設定還是沒有辦法改變（e.g. 我不喜歡鍵盤「4」、「5」的設定，覺得剛好顛倒過來），不過光是把系統提示原本的「手把按鍵顯示」改為「鍵盤按鍵顯示」，在 PC 上用鍵盤控制的玩家就方便不少，不用再看著手把按鍵的顯示，想著這是對應到什麼鍵盤按鍵。

我再次強調是[b][u]系統層級[/u][/b]的鍵盤設定沒有辦法改變。[u]戰鬥時候的鍵盤設定[/u]是可以自由修改的，想把補充水的設定改掉？完全可以的。[strike]總是有人沒看清楚我寫的、還是看不懂中文就在留言吵[/strike]

原本的一些問題也做了修正，像 CPU 使用率不會飆高等等，不過多人遊戲 Crash 的問題還是存在，只要對方沒有注意，就會大家一起掛掉。不過現在此遊戲也幾乎是鬼服，多人遊戲根本沒有什麼人在線。

不過倒是遇到一些新的 Bug，在多人遊戲的生存戰裡面，有時候小怪會直接卡在舞台下面，然後還能攻擊的到神櫓（要保護的東西），一般水槍還攻擊不到，只能使用技能解決。另外一個是，如果把比賽開場的動畫略掉時會無法攻擊，應該是他還認定在動畫中，進而鎖定你的攻擊行為。


[h1]遊戲[/h1]

基本這個遊戲就是水槍射擊大戰的動作遊戲，可也不用考慮那麼多，用力（用水）射妹子與怪物。看到妹子倒地，就衝上去開啟「扭扭模式」，享受妹子被水噴灑而嬌羞的快感，不過關鍵部位會有聖光，想要去聖光或是其他各種難以言喻的東西，可以去找 mod 來用。

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1486586036

另外不得不提，電腦控制的隊友 AI 略低，後面只能靠提升他們等級與武器技能，來讓他們別那麼容易陣亡，不過唯一優點大概就是不會迷路、走錯地方，跟他們走就絕對不會有錯！

[h1]劇情[/h1]

基本上不需要玩過系列其他作品就能遊玩此遊戲，像我沒有玩過此系列的其他作品，不過看遊戲劇情，我還是能大概理解角色們的性格與關係。至於主線劇情是怎樣......嘛，反正只是找個理由，讓女孩子盡情來場水槍大戰 XD

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1487989112

[h1]更衣室[/h1]

可以幫女孩子們隨意打扮，換泳裝、換衣服、新增各種裝飾品，還可以拿水槍射她們，以及跟祂們做親密接觸、看他們的反應。不過這部分用鍵盤滑鼠來操控的手感略不佳


真要說還有什麼缺點的話....

1. 开放世界，包含了boss狩猎，战友（人+兽）培养，钓鱼，挑战等常见的开放世界元素
2. 武器系统，武器属性不再随机，随机的是镶嵌用宝玉，但大多是数值上的差别，以往的各种属性现在以装饰品体现出来。以及删去了易武攻击，只能装备一把武器，新增了弓箭系统
3. 武将存档，自由模式并不能自由切换武将，每个武将有自己单独的存档
4. 地图风景，光荣努力在游戏中还原各种中国名胜，黄龙，长城，太湖，壶口瀑布等都能找到，这点大赞！能再现我国地大物博的游戏可是屈指可数！
5. 照片模式，天气，时间，表情，特效任你改！疫情在家没事干？游戏里拍遍中国！
6. 据点系统，可以购买各处的房产，然后可以更改家具配置，房屋外观等，装修系统比较捡漏，可用家具数量少，有待改进
        以上的特点也是备受争议的点。至于三国无双的铁粉到底该忠于原来的三国还是该鼓励现在的创新，那就是仁者见仁智者见智了。希望光荣能从358的创新中取其精华，做出更好的359来。",

DYNASTY WARRIORS 9,schinese,"[h1]358，我对这款游戏真是又爱又恨[/h1]

恨它的价格，恨它舍弃了前作优秀的系统，恨它糅合了一堆乱七八糟没什么用的东西，恨它把开放世界做成这个鸟样
但是我对无双系列又是爱不释手，无双系列里面对战国无双和真三国无双格外喜爱，这款正统续作也不例外
[h1]游玩感受[/h1]
首先，这款游戏的优化是真的垃圾，我不想说啥了，卡顿是常有的事，而在我想方设法解决这个问题的时候，我发现了这款游戏配合Steam上的一款软件[b]“CPUcores”[/b]一起食用效果拔群，当然另外购买软件的费用也算是额外消费了，[b]而且也不是对所有的电脑都有所提升，只是我使用的两台电脑都有很大的改观[/b]
配音方面，增加了中配，一开始我对中配一向有偏见，感觉很垃圾，但是这游戏的中配简直 太棒了，预期，情绪，都表现出来了，而且翻译的质量很高，很有年代感，还经常会使用一些四字成语，甚至还纠正了几个我一直念错的字
音效也有一些改观，雨天和晴天的音效有差别，在室内城门下会有回声，这个细节简直赞
[h1]游戏的改动[/h1]
这款游戏一改前作卖作品的收费模式，改为了卖武将，而不购买武将的话，也可以使用免费的武将完成游戏来解锁其他的武将，游戏的本体可以说是提前解锁武将了吧，而游戏的故事模式，也不再是前作那样势力剧情，而是改为了武将列传，使用一个武将体验他自己的戎马一生，这个改动我觉得很赞，每个武将都有自己的过场动画和剧情了，更有了代入感，同时也让这款游戏更肝了，毕竟想玩完所有的故事模式就要把94个武将全都玩一遍，甚至还有DLC中的剧情

开放世界的改变，是本作的另一个大改动，一改前作的区域战斗，变成了开放世界，但是我感觉光荣对开放世界的理解可能有点误区，我一度以为这不是无双，这是育碧新开发的三国游戏，大地图扫点，收集物品，没什么用的陷阱捕捉，钓鱼，料理等等功能，虽说丰富了游戏，但是用处真的不大，尤其是攻城战，本作可以说给攻城战制造了一个声势浩大的场景，攻城武器，冲车，井阑，齐射队，一应俱全，甚至还给这个世界布置了一个日夜更替的时间，让攻城战在晚上停止，好让玩家静悄悄的潜入进行突袭，听上去是不错，但是真的玩起来，无论是队友还是敌人，人群混在一起，却没什么进展，整个游戏剧情的推动，完全靠玩家一个人来东奔西走，明明是大地图的开放世界，我在成都帮村民打老虎，为什么在江陵进行的攻城战要等我去才开始呢！而且只要我不在参与战斗，这场战斗可以打到我笔记本没电也没个结果，而去了，蜘蛛侠附体的玩家就会使用钩爪进入城内直接秒掉城内防卫，打开城门迎接友军，便完成了攻略，这特么是我一个人的表演啊！

此外，如果有护送友军推进的剧情，友军会因为沿途路上有一个没有打死的小兵而停下来跟小兵对峙半天，只有玩家打死了小兵，友军才会继续前进，要知道前作跟随友军，我都是很难追上的，只要没有带字的队长或者武将，就会推进，但是这作莫名的感觉一群智障队友，推进太难了，基本每一场最后的战斗都是玩家一人孤身奋战，秒掉对方总大将。
而我超级喜欢的355的武将单挑系统，从5之后就再也没有回归过，玩家单枪匹马进去正打得high呢，被一个手贱的小兵捅了菊花，那感觉可真是不爽啊，加上战斗中随时会弹出的反击提醒和突袭提醒，有时候正在连招地方武将的时候，按了一下Y直接就飞奔到隔壁去弹死一个小兵，我整个人都是汗颜的

武器系统和马匹系统较前作来说差的太远了，没有什么技巧可言了，武器就是通过打猎换取特殊的货币换打造券来打造，强行打猎继承育碧的垃圾远哭诟病，而马匹则是达到相应的结局解锁后在马厩里面随即刷出来，购买即可，毫无难度而且还要肝马等级，DLC直接走的属性它不香吗？

客将系统我很喜欢，比起前几作带侍卫还是带其他武将更有成就感，不过就是有一些时候会感觉奇怪，比如带着张角打黄巾军，总感觉可以玩出很多花来

机票的价格简直就是抢钱，但是里面有一些额外的剧本和好康的衣服，真是让我欲罢不能啊，真香了，购买的话，功能性地点和剧本可以入，衣服看情况吧，如今出了整合，趁着打折一起入了倒也不是很贵。

[h1]最后的碎碎念[/h1]
真三系列每一作出来都会有很大的改动，一直保持着摒弃前作优良内容，开发越来越复杂的内容，这作可以说是直接改头换面，然而画质手感还是那个样，可能光荣真的钻了牛角尖了，往奇怪的方向发展了，希望如果有续作的话，光荣可以改掉这些问题，继承不是坏处，但是择优择莠需要光荣认真考量",
DYNASTY WARRIORS 9,schinese,"[h1]前言[/h1]
说到“三国”题材的游戏，不少玩家可能会先入为主地想到《三国志》《三国群英传》《霸王大陆》等优秀的策略游戏。通过谋略连横合纵乃至一统天下，让人驰神往。不过并非每个玩家都对烧脑的策略类游戏情有独钟。对于他们来说，与其对着一串串抽象的数值与表格乐呵，化身为传奇武将驰骋与战场上，如探囊取物般取敌军上将首级要更具吸引力。

有需求自然就会有市场，不少动作类“三国”游戏作品应运而生。早期街机平台的上CAPCOM的《吞食天地：赤壁之战》，IGS的《三国战纪》都受到为数不少的玩家们的青睐。

以《三国志》《信长之野望》《大航海时代》等优秀策略游戏为玩家所熟知的光荣公司，也看出了这片市场的潜力，凭借《真·三国无双》系列在动作游戏领域杀出一片天。不同于以往的那些清版过关类三国游戏。《真·三国无双》系列的厉害之处在于他以3d画面为玩家带来了一片广袤的拟真战场。玩家将操作有如吕奉先，赵子龙，锦马超等战功赫赫的将领，或是貂蝉，大小乔等同时代的传奇美女，冲入敌人队伍中如同斩瓜切菜般化解敌人的军势。

脱胎于PS平台的格斗游戏《三国无双》的《真·三国无双》尚属试验作品，关卡数量少，且未加入武器收集要素，并没有在业界泛起多大波澜。不过有着以一敌众的玩法以及无双乱舞的设定的它，已具备了后来“无双割草”类游戏的雏形。紧锣密鼓于次年发行的《真·三国无双2》在游戏机制方面则进行了不少改进。如加入了角色养成，武器收集，调整了敌人出兵数量规模，并引入了跟多的将领。恰到好处的难度与爽快的手感使其不仅荣登FAMI通白金殿堂，更是在诸多玩家的认可下，取得了破百万销量的优秀成绩。

取得了不错成绩后的光荣公司此时也非常具有商业头脑，借鉴了自家《三国志》和《信长之野望》中出了正传再出一波“PK”威力剪加强版的模式。通过对原版游戏中的诸多要素进一步加强，然后以《猛将传》的形式再圈上一波人气。到了《真·三国无双3》时更是衍生出了添加了内政系统等策略要素的《帝国》系列。就此每出一部作就以原版，《猛将传》，《帝国》的三驾马车整上一遍的模式成了系列标配。

在《真·三国无双》取得不错成绩后，以日本战国题材为背景的《战国无双》系列对借该模式进行借鉴也并取得了不错的成绩。“无双”类游戏俨然成为了那个年代一块炙手可热的香饽饽。连CAPCOM也不由得捣鼓出了自家的“无双割草”游戏《战国Basara》系列，希望分上一杯羹。

随着时间的推移，无双类游戏通过与其他各大知名IP通过合作的模式遍地开花，《高达无双》《北斗无双》《海贼无双》《塞尔达无双》《剑风传奇无双》《亚尔斯兰战记×无双》等作品悉数登场。

然而这看似欣欣向荣之景象，却无法掩盖“无双”系列销量整体下滑的趋势。所谓穷则变，变则通，通则久。变革的重任落在了《真·三国无双8》的肩上......

《真·三国无双8》虽自2013年《真·三国无双7》问世后，官方就已透露出了风声。这次它没有保持着该系列以往2-3年出一部的周期出现，而是进入了蛰伏期。直至2015年官方才放出了要将《真·三国无双8》打造成开发世界游戏的消息。消息一经放出众多无双爱好者们立马沸腾了。可以操作爱将领驰骋在不在被空气墙所框住的神州大地上，横扫千军的场面在脑海中浮现。

而当2018年2月游戏正式发售时，它却给玩家们以及无双系列带来的却是一场空前的灾难......

不时出现的bug，劝退效果十足卡顿，不仅仅是PC平台，连向来要稳定很多的主机端亦是如此。笔者同样因为流畅度问题而只能把作品先搁置一边。在时隔近两年，偶然得知游戏的bug已被修复地差不多，才鼓起勇气再次打开这款曾被差评覆盖的争议之作一探究竟。


[h1]大幅改进的战斗系统[/h1]
本作的战斗系统舍弃了以往按下不同次数普通攻击后再按下蓄力攻击，可以施放出各种赏心悦目特殊攻击的""C技""系统。而是进行了大刀阔斧的革新，通过""连贯攻击""，""触发攻击""，""反应攻击""这一套机制将其取而代之。""连贯攻击""即是通过连续按下X普通攻击按键施放的平砍连续技。通过手柄RB键配合X，Y，B三个按键释可以放出的使敌人昏厥、浮空、跌倒的""反应攻击""。

当然主角被敌人包围或敌人体力减少到一定量等情况时，敌人头顶会亮起大大的“Y”按键提示，玩家按下按键后，即可发动可以直接无视敌人的防御并造成巨大伤害的""触发攻击""。玩家如果为反应攻击上镶嵌了带有特殊属性的玉石的话。那么玩家接下来的普通攻击会附带上对应反应攻击的特殊属性。只要玩家的攻击连段不停下来，那么属性效果可以一直持续下去不消失。

前两作中的武将可以装备两把武器的“易武”系统被取消。玩家可以随心所欲的更改角色所装备的兵器。为了让角色间不会因为可以随便装备其他武将的专有武器，而导致各个角色的动作显得的同质化。角色之间会通过专有的RB+A的特殊招式，以及的空中、地上两套无双乱舞技作出区分。

为了研发新的战斗系统取消了系列标志性的“C技”系统的做法，在梗早的另一款探索之作《真·三国无双5》时同样发生过。不过相比《真·三国无双5》中几乎一个攻击键就可以搞定的“连舞系统”。本作的这套新战斗系统明显有着更多可取之处。玩家角色原先的C技能的部分动作被拆开分配到各个反应攻击的位置中。玩家在攻击敌人的过程中可以根据个人需要，灵活地通过各种反应攻击控场，如同行云流水般可以将敌人一套带走。


[h1]更多的登场角色[/h1]
本作的登场角色人数在《真·三国无双7》的基础上进一步扩充，达到了94名。登场的角色基本遵循了自己在三国史上的活跃时间。例如，蜀国的整体剧情跨度有十三章节，刘备在历史上活到了夷陵战，于是游戏中刘备的章节为从黄巾之乱的第一章到夷陵之战的第十章，而在董卓包围战中殉职的华雄同志则仅仅只有一二两章节，其他角色也是同理。角色之间虽然会有共同剧情下共用动画的情况，不过对每个角色都有着完整的剧情交代。


[h1]动态的世界与牵一发而动全身任务系统[/h1]
这个世界会有着日夜交替，晴雨变化地天候要素。玩家在游戏的同时，其他势力的角色同时也在攻城拔寨互相交战。
任务系统的设计方面有着“牵一发而动全身”的概念。游戏的每一大章中会由着一个主线任务与多个支线任务构成。主线任务往往会有着较高的等级要求，玩家与敌人将领相差10级以上，敌人会被带有霸体效果的斗气所覆盖，难以战胜，在从一定程度上对玩家越级打BOSS直接完成章节的想法做出了限制。玩家需要通过完成支线来缓解压力。完成支线为主角带来金钱、道具、经验值等奖励的同时，游戏的主线会因为对战局有利因素的达成而下降任务等级要求。而所达成的支线对其他相关联的支线任务也会有着相应的积极影响。


[h1]关于本作的开放世界[/h1]
[b]理想很丰满现实很骨感[/b]

无双系列会走上开放世界的路线，其实在《真·三国无双6》中玩家可以在非战斗状态下的自由巡视大营模式中可见端倪。通过官方2017年5月的已给出的40%开发进度的消息，以及2018年2月的发售期，可以大体推测出《真·三国无双8》的开发周期为3年。完全没有开放世界游戏经验的无双开发团队花3年世界去挑战无缝式的巨大的中国版图，有点初生牛犊不怕虎的精神。但要知道2000人团队做了8年，整整烧了56亿《荒野大镖客：救赎2》团队，姑且也只做出了美国版图上的几个州。

想要在如此巨大的地图上营造了一个让人信服并沉浸其中的高自由度世界，必然要大量的细节堆砌。以制作组在的预算来说必然是远远不够的，更不要提光多达94名需要单独设计的武将就需要消耗到大量的预算。而这也注定了这个游戏世界的空洞性。拿“草船借箭”个支线任务来举例。玩家需要操作主角跳上船，然后船自动移向目的地，到达目的地后在船的模型自动生成（注意是“生成”）了一堆箭，任务完成......估计凡是听过展现诸葛亮过人智慧与胆识的《草船借箭》故事的玩家，此时都感到自己智商受到到严重的侮辱。

[b]快节奏的无双+慢节奏的开放世界模式[/b]

一些常见如《上古卷轴》《辐射》《孤岛惊魂》等开放世界游戏在节奏上显得相对慢一些。例如在《上古卷轴》中，玩家通过潜行击杀敌人可以带来的巨大收益，会然玩家玩家忽略掉自己漫长的潜伏时间，而繁琐的搜刮宝物时间中不时出现的新鲜道具促使着玩家对于这个世界进一步探索的欲望。这些设计理念与无双系列的快节奏其实是有些冲突的，所以当制作组最初宣布要《真三国无双8》做将其制作成开发世界游戏时，笔者对制作组会通过什么样的方法来处理这个问题充满期待。

不过游戏最终所呈现的效果却有些不尽人意，角色到达对于的地点接任务，并有些生硬地加入了养成，潜行，鸟瞰点，采集，狩猎，钓鱼，购买房产等要素，这种直接将无双往常见开放世界类RPG游戏中套的做法肯定是不妥的。

且不提角色弯下腰，敌人便无法发现自己的有些自欺欺人的粗糙潜行，右摇杆灵敏度都很成问题的操作弓箭狩猎。原本系列中应该一气呵成战场爽快感，也在开发世界的任务机制下被分割地七零八落。当玩家完成一个任务后想要去完成下一个任务，要么骑马骑上个几百甚至几千米，要么使用传送功能直接送达任务点附近。不希望将本作玩成枯燥的骑马模拟器的玩家必然会选择后者。于是游戏陷入了一种奇怪的节奏之中。玩家将一次又一次传送到任务点附近，干掉几队兵几个敌将，再传送到下一个任务点，如此往复下去，直到通过游戏。

[b]需要调整的游戏定位[/b]

就目前情况来看，本作的开放世界显得噱头大于实际。生硬地去套用开发世界，同时丢掉了自己的原先的优势犹如邯郸学步。既无法让受过《上古卷轴》《辐射》《刺客信条》等有着开发世界游戏熏陶的玩家买涨，同时也无法满足追求爽快的系列老玩家。
找准对游戏的定位也许是当务之急。拿《骑马与砍杀》与《侍道》这两款优秀小成本作品举例。

《骑马与砍杀》最初的团队小到仅仅由一对土耳其小夫妻组成。虽然同是开放世界题材，但制作组并没有以卵击石地先通过建模去面面俱到的制作卡拉迪亚大陆，而是通过大地图小地图切换的模式，省下大量资源投入到更需要的地方。

《侍道》系列中不够精细且不时会穿插的模型，以及大量的剧情场景的重复利用，早已显现了作品较低的预算，但是制作组紧紧抓剑道中的“构”与“架”的战斗系统，并通过众多脑洞大开的有趣支线任务丰满其整个世界，同样获得不少玩家的认可。

无双系列又何尝不能在开发的过程中用上类似这样巧劲呢？制作组在无双游戏制作的资源分配上其实应该花上更多的心思。与其将为数不多的资源地力求面面俱到苦于招架，甚至发售日期急急忙忙交卷，呈现出大量空洞经不起推敲的内容。倒不如快刀斩乱麻地进行合理取舍，对于作品的优点留下更多精力去打磨。


[h1]作品中一些值得称赞的改进[/h1]
本作整体质量虽被稍显得空洞开放世界所拖累，但一些相比之前作品进步的地方还是有目共睹的。

[b]联机模式的加入[/b]

昔日的2P分屏式本地联机可谓是难为了不少已经不再有小伙伴陪在身边一起玩游戏的玩家。本作则终于加入在线联机模式。
游戏的联机模式借鉴同社的《仁王》并进行了部分改进。想要联机的小伙伴，打开招募伙伴的开关，即可让自己联机房间出现了公共的联机列表上，自己继续游戏即可，静候有人加入即可。想要加入到他人房间中共同游玩的玩家，可以通过联机列表来选择自己想要加入的房间，即可加入游戏共同游玩。这比玩家每一次联机都要先在大厅中等个半天，人齐了才能能开始游戏的联机方式要便捷不少的。

[b]自动存档机制[/b]

本作加入了自动存档功能。玩家不用担心忘了存档而导致大段进度要重新推，也不会像昔日的无双作品那样一场战斗中一着不慎满盘皆输。玩家在战斗过程中不慎挂掉，会在直接回到最近的自动存档点。

[b]更加细致的角色表现[/b]

角色在淋雨后会变湿，掉落在沙土环境在身上会变脏。在密闭环境中说话会有回音。部分角色在不同时期样貌也会进行调整，例如刘备初期是无须青年，到了后期会蓄起小胡子，夏侯惇在眼睛未中箭前，会以上双眼完好的相貌示人。

[b]全中文的配音[/b]

多年前的昙花一现台湾配音的《真三国无双2》让不少无双爱好者印象深刻。本作则第一次加入了字正腔圆的大陆本土普通话配音。中文版角色的整体配音效果与角色情感表达上尽量贴近了日配版。不仅仅是主要角色，一些无关紧要的NPC同样有着配音。这对于长期把注意力放在看字幕上而无不能全部放到角色演出上的国人玩家来说还是非常友好的。期待以后作品也可以保持下去了。


[h1]个人对于无双系列的一点小建议[/h1]
游戏的战斗难度方面对于笔者来说，相比后来为了让跟对玩家轻松获得“割草”爽快感的无双，稍微带些挑战性的《真三国无双2》和《真三国无双3》从某种程度上更具吸引力一些。后续的作品玩家虽然可以通过选项自行提升难度，但所谓的高难度却几乎清一色的采用敌人输出狂涨来秒人的粗暴手段，让人望而却步。在“魂”系列掀起的合理的硬核难度的思潮下。“无双”系列其实应该好好对游戏难度这块为未开坑之地进行挖掘。前不久《星球大战绝地：陨落的武士团》里对难度的把控就是一个很好的例子，同时兼顾里硬核向与轻松向两类玩家的口味。期待无双系列也采用类似的做法。例如高难度下，敌人将领的AI大幅提高，更考验玩家的操作与反应力，对于容错率也留有余地不至于经常出现玩家动不动被秒的情况。操作能力不太行的玩家依旧可以通过最低难度体验游戏的爽快感,各得其乐。


[h1]结语[/h1]
《真三国无双8》作为系列尝试变革的又一款探索之作，虽然总体上显得并不是太成功。但制作组没有一成不变，而愿意去大幅革新的态度还是值得肯定的。希望制作组在开发系列下一作时可以根据预算，团队规模更好的找准定位。在力求改进的同时也不要将自己的强项不能很好的体现。也期待该以后《真三国无双》系列作品可以再次让玩家们有着初次见到《真三国无双2》《真三国无双3》时那种久违的眼前一亮的感觉了。",bLi Xiang Hen Feng Man Xian Shi Hen Gu Gan b bKuai Jie Zou De Wu Shuang Man Jie Zou De Kai Fang Shi Jie Mo Shi b bXu Yao Diao Zheng De You Xi Ding Wei b bLian Ji Mo Shi De Jia Ru b bZi Dong Cun Dang Ji Zhi b bGeng Jia Xi Zhi De Jiao Se Biao Xian b bQuan Zhong Wen De Pei Yin b

官方更新的追加・修改内容介绍

这游戏到现在已经有九个月了，也更新优化了不少问题（虽然很多地方不尽人意）
然而免费体验又带来一批零点几的风评玩家也是服了（请把好钢用在刀刃上）

我已经玩了200+小时，只能说这代的潜力和野心都非常大，跑边界我247速度的马跑了快两个小时，光荣想丰富一下三国无双系列，很多细节并没有被玩家重视，因为这和割草有什么关系呢？共同模组，重复剧情等等变成半成品大概是因为资金超出了预算（庞大的开放地图和细致的角色建模都是巨大的开支），优化差也是因为地图的物体建模块面太多，所以才导致了各种吐槽（希望在后面会逐渐补充完善）

然而喜欢这代的，都在默默玩
被风评带着的，依然要坚持来踩踩
至于很多老玩家，光荣就是个sb，你tm直接重置3-7代不就好了，天天就想着创新续命，费力不讨好，为什么不直接啃老本呢，重置个七遍八遍的，天天都香，代代都赚

DYNASTY WARRIORS 9,schinese,"[h1]2018年4月26日这一天是个值得纪念的日子，因为这一天从我身上印证了一个千古名言“明知山有虎偏向虎山行”。此时的真.三国无双8评论区已是约4000多差评和700多好评，实实在在的差评如潮。显然这次我也是下足了决心，从网上购买的序列号，想退款都不行了。这可真是三杯翔下肚，发烧都TM烧坏脑子了。[/h1]

[u]但是上述内容全部都是是废话，下面的才是主体：[/u]
说实话游戏发售后的差评，的确把我是吓退了一波，所以很长时间以来一直迟迟没敢去入手。当然网络上有很多人可能也是跟风给个差评的，这点可以理解毕竟我们中国大部分人从心底都鄙视日厂的，价格高.素质差.卖情怀.搞双平台，还有发售后提高价格。但是作为一款三国题材的游戏不是由中国人自己出的，让别人来做的话要求也就不用那么多了，比起光荣更可耻的是某些中国的厂商，使三国成为噱头不断地从玩家手中捞金。究其根本三国题材的游戏为什么能像现在这般火，而不是中国的其他的历史题材，还是因为真.三国无双将其推上了世界的舞台。然而说了这么多，在游戏初期我就被赋予一种强烈的国产网游的错觉，但是当我意识到它还是真三国无双后，除了DLC卖的贵应该不会出什么氪金的选项。所以又继续坚持游玩了5个来小时。平心而论，其实去掉优化渣，闪退，隐藏中文，而且发售初期BUG有点多的这几个事实以外，这个游戏还算不错。而且搞好现在这几点说不定现在最起码也是好评多点的褒贬不一，也不至于是差如潮，毕竟无双都出了这么多代了，也想革新一下惊艳一下玩家。很明显它去借鉴了上古卷轴和刺客信条等类似的沙盒开放式游戏的因素，但是同样明显的是他们没能够把握好分寸，这也就是5小时之后能够得到的结果。
所以在此挑出几点的粗略的说一下：
[b]其一	[/b]，本身前作简化的操作，在这一部被变得尤为复杂，本来就是普通攻击加蓄力，这一部却搞了一个什么触发攻击。然而打击感也为了写实化，让人草割的很是不爽。尤其是再加上那卡顿，我尼玛简直都要去日天了。
[b]其二	[/b]，写实化使得人物明显是变丑了，尤其是魏国的那几个人都是什么一套呀，我从3开始最喜欢的就是夏侯和周泰，这一部竟然给我丑成这般样子。而且丑不要紧，你给搞什么动态头像呀，这下我不看他都不行了。我宁可不要动态头像，你把前几代的原画的还我好不好。而且加上那蹩脚的配音，真尼玛绝了个腚的了。
[b]其三	[/b]，IF路线在这一作被去掉了，我堂堂吕奉先都打到袁绍老家了，董卓那老贼却给我撤兵了，然而之前我砍曹操都追上砍死了，剧情却让他给我跑了。
[b]其四	[/b]，沙盒—公式—刷刷刷，任务的重复性太高。好吧，当然不是重复性太高，那有些太过了。是完全一样呀！好不好！！！每次接到一个支线都是跑到一个点，清几个杂兵，完成交任务。能不能给点有趣的呀，真三国无双七帝国虽然他们都说是渣作，但是它的支线最起码有意思呀，最起码也不是单纯的跑点刷呀。本身就有传送和自动寻路了，你咋不再给我一个挂机系统，让我当贪玩蓝月得了。光荣呀！光荣！沙盒游戏优点这么多，你怎么就只学到了一个公式呢？
[spoiler]其五，这一作都成这样了，为什么还没有出破解版？ (:D) [/spoiler]
但是即使真三国无双8这么差劲，从游戏还依旧在更新这一点可以看出，光荣暂时还没有像其他的日厂那样，口碑差的话干脆直接放弃，例如某表的保护伞小队和某K的幸存，他们还是依旧在试图挽回玩家的口碑的。说的好听些只能说这次的真三国无双8出的有些过早了，缺乏时间去打磨。所以还是要暂时保留好评，毕竟300多块大洋如果不喜欢这个游戏就不会买了，而且这几年没几个国外游戏有中文配音了（虽然人物配音真鸡儿差，听到张辽那就果断换回日文了）。希望光荣能看到这些评论好自为之吧，让玩家能够在以后能玩到一个更好的三国无双。

好吧，我承认这游戏剧情食了shi了。关羽剧情里什么叫“顺路砍几个袁绍的将领，以报答曹操大人”？而且没斩颜良文丑不说，我千里走单骑什么时候变成带着刘备和张飞赵云一块走了。刘备路上那时时还说一句的“要哭了大，云桑（干得好，云长）”好像还在提醒我他会一直在我身边，与我共进退。什么东西啊！干脆叫“三国兄贵行”得了！",uDan Shi Shang Shu Nei Rong Quan Bu Du Shi Shi Fei Hua Xia Mian De Cai Shi Zhu Ti u Suo Yi Zai Ci Tiao Chu Ji Dian De Cu Lue De Shuo Yi Xia  bQi Yi  bQi Er  bQi San  bQi Si  d spoiler

DYNASTY WARRIORS 9,schinese,"[h1]我要为光荣鸣不平，我到底是不是圣母洗地党，请看完

你们最关心的问题：[b]汉化[/b]

我已经独自为两个厂家的三个游戏完成过简中汉化，正在帮助第三个厂家的第四个游戏完成官中配音，所以我接触的此类的内容比较多（我指的游戏的翻译环节了解的应该比大部分玩家要多一些），关于你们最近特别上心的光荣删中文引起大量差评这件事，帮光荣鸣一声冤枉

光荣从1985年就开始开发制作三国类游戏，一直到今天已经整整三十多年了，这里我只是顺带一提，我们不去探究他是不是对我国三国题材非常热爱，我们来提他另一点

光荣作为一个[b]商人[/b]，不仅为真三8制作了简体中文（非机翻），[b]甚至还为[u]每一位武将[/u]的[u]每一句台词[/u]都制作了简体中文的配音[/b]，光荣也只是制作了英语日语和汉语的配音，花这么大功夫，就是给你们秀一下“你们看我们光荣就是专门费这么大劲做中文和配音给你们看看然后就是不给你们用~略略略~”
？？？
有病吗？

然而他却在PS4和XBOX上提供中文内容，为什么呢？这里我们要说到第二个公司：[b]索尼[/b]

索尼为了保证自己的销量，曾出过一个霸王条款，也就是我们说的独占，具体内容不多说，在后来PC市场打开之后，日本几个大厂商渐渐越来越看重PC市场，在和索尼协商多次之后，索尼只在游戏独占上让步了，但是还握着很多版权，其中就有翻译权（也许不叫这个名字，但是你们知道我说的是什么就行了）和额外内容独有权（独占DLC），其他厂商后来就干脆不制作这额外的独占DLC了，但是翻译这个东西，没办法啊，[b]有些steam上的日厂游戏没有日语配音的原因也是和这个翻译版权有关。[/b]

接下来回到重点，真三8的中文删除事件，如果我是光荣，可以发布以下公告：

[b]大家好，我是光荣脱裤魔，我们原本在将真三8移植到PC时，讨论过是否暂时删除中文部分，等索尼版权到期之后再提供给中国玩家，但是后来大家觉得没有必要，所以就干脆先把中文的部分和整个游戏一起放出来，等索尼那边版权结束之后我们再直接改一下文件直接把中文开放了，也免得你们大家再去下载两个多G的中文补丁。但是最近我们发现，中国的玩家找到了自己的办法，通过修改游戏文件来强行使用中文内容，对此我们表示理解，但是，[u]因为这部分中文是我们光荣脱裤魔自己制作的，当你们使用的时候这就会涉及到我们将涉嫌侵犯索尼的版权[/u]，要知道，对于任何国家来说，侵权都是一个极其严重的事情，出于无奈，我们只能把中文内容先移走了，另外如果你们继续刷差评的话，我们完全可以今后不再在中国提供游戏购买服务（锁区）和为后续游戏制作中文和配音的打算，另外我们还将依法追究中国玩家对于非法修改游戏文件的法律责任，我们在游戏公告和协议中写的非常清楚，禁止私自修改游戏文件！谢谢各位玩家对版权的理解！[/b]

如果光荣真的这么做了，你们怎么办？

以上[/h1]

另外，对于真三8的实际版权控制我可能说错了，可能这次不是索尼，但是之前都是索尼
另外可能有人问为什么XBOX上也有中文？因为索尼和微软对游戏机市场有相对和谐的协议，他们是俩不会打起来的！他们只会联合起来对抗PC市场对他们游戏机市场的冲击

[h1]最后还有一个问题，真三8的优化问题[/h1]

我已经通关了蜀国主线，我并没有遇到明显甚至严重的丢帧现象（GTX1066，16G内存，SSD，I7-4790），花屏和贴图闪动只遇到过一次，而且并不严重，只是天气莫名变亮了一下，铃木亮浩也亲自在推特保证正在针对优化问题制作补丁

提供一个画质优化思路：关闭游戏内置的抗锯齿，略微降低草地特效，略微降低视野范围，用英伟达控制面板来使用英伟达的抗锯齿效果，还可以把光照也这么设置，会提高很多帧率，我全程帧率平均在50-60，我有开垂直同步，这游戏优化的确有不小问题，但是绝没有那么夸张，别动不动就尝试2K和4K就会好很多的（认真

真三国无双8只是光荣对开放世界的一个尝试，一个试水作，很多细节都并不太帮，但是说真的，这个游戏很不错

[h1]恳请各位理智，不要盲目跟风刷差评，刷差评只会体现出素质问题，并不能改变实际情况，也不会得到任何国家玩家的怜悯和一同谴责[/h1]

--------

[h1][b]就知道抓着删中文这件事不放，你们买了游戏不遵守协议好意思？你们不修改游戏文件的话别人会删你中文？是你们犯错在先，逼的对方删了中文的懂吗？没版权意识是真的可怕[/b][/h1]",Ni Men Zui Guan Xin De Wen Ti bYi Hua b You Bing Ma  Ru Guo Guang Rong Zhen De Zhe Yao Zuo Liao Ni Men Zen Yao Ban

The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II,schinese,"前提注：我是以闪1的后半部、抑或闪1的大型DLC的定位来评价闪2的，原因是我不认为闪2可以作为一部独立的游戏进行评判

宏大的故事背景和丰富多样的角色塑造，这是闪1延续的传统了，很多NPC都非常可爱，比如双胞胎姐妹啦、天然呆草帽少女啦+
巡游帝国东部带来的绝佳沉浸感，利贝尔和克州的舞台跟帝国比起来太小啦+
结局相当符合我的胃口，悲伤中有振奋，虚无中有希望+
连着玩1+2的话体验其实非常不错，所以说强行拆分真的要不得+
我永远喜欢班长，黄道落雨绝对是闪轨最美S技+

高性价比+

无意义的注水内容过多，整个第二部的剧情展开非常拖沓-
毫无价值的支线和收集内容过多，委托的质量甚至比闪1都不如，大都相当无趣-
叙事节奏不佳，典型头轻脚重，前30个小时不及后3个小时获取的信息量-
机械降神式的都合展开过多，永远恰好救场的神奇队友，更神奇的的是来救场的并没有主角队能打-
强行剧情杀过多，玩家从头跪倒尾，为了保持Boss逼格强行降低主角队实力，使得玩家体感极差-
为什么外篇是罗伊德机体搞地下游击而不是黎恩机体抓克州土匪-

总之，玩了闪1就得玩闪2，不然两部作品都是不完整的。
闪2整体上的主要缺点还是注水内容太多……实话说真的删了注水内容直接做成闪1的付费DLC会好很多，然而Falcom的财报（捂脸",Jie Ju Xiang Dang Fu He Wo De Wei Kou Bei Shang Zhong You Zhen Fen Xu Wu Zhong You Xi Wang  Wo Yong Yuan Xi Huan Ban Chang Huang Dao Luo Yu Jue Dui Shi Shan Gui Zui Mei sJi  Gao Xing Jie Bi  Wu Yi Yi De Zhu Shui Nei Rong Guo Duo Zheng Ge Di Er Bu De Ju Qing Zhan Kai Fei Chang Tuo Ta

游戏最后的旧校舍可以购买角色幻化饰品，有点小贵，肯刷钱的话应该都能买齐。我的首选当然是苍之歌姬，毕竟第二柱，好强的。

小提示：
1.劳拉装备金牛核心回路和霸道回路后，进入战斗第一次攻击可以打出4倍多的伤害。利用连结增强以后第一击使用S技可以打出超过20万的伤害。
2.黎恩装备丛云或者渡鸦核心回路，提升自己的速度同时用孤影斩降低敌人速度，可以使普通的敌人从头到尾完全无法动弹。
3.非的回路和装备配置得当，可以使得她的物理回避率达到120%，同时魔法回避率也能达到100%。但是对大BOSS的地图炮貌似无效。
4.艾丽莎建议装备天使核心回路以及打败幻兽获得的怜月珠，BOSS开局就放失落的魔法，将所有队员的HP撑到2倍，这样可以避免地图炮导致队伍全灭。
5.班长艾玛使用罪恶回路，增加魔法暴击率是相当有用的，比默认的那个战斗中回复EP有用得多。
6.最后的旧校舍最好把雪伦带上，她的回复用战技可以节约很多道具。另外公主的S技是全体反弹一次物理攻击，CP200时是反弹一次物理和魔法攻击，善加利用也会打的很轻松。
7.小丑和虹吸不如闪之轨迹1好用。",Xiao Ti Shi

The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II,schinese,"第一次写轨迹系列的长篇评价就要献给这部“历代最差”的闪之轨迹2了，想想也有些唏嘘。近年来，Falcom的作品似乎差评越来越多，零碧轨不如空轨，闪轨又不如零碧轨，东京迷城也不怎么样，唯有伊苏8还可以看一看，“法老空在走下坡路”，几乎每个F社玩家都在这么说。以我之见，Falcom在闪轨2上犯的错误和我之前在东京迷城说的一样，主线剧情灌水和人物刻画不够。

[h1] 主线剧情	[/h1]

闪轨1结局的发展，至少还是让人非常期待的，帝国的内战，失散的同伴，背叛的挚友，但是万万没想到，到了闪轨2的剧情只能用灌水两个字形容。

闪轨2的剧情总体构架和空轨SC十分相似，上半部周游各种以前去过的地方，找回VII组同学，然后每章最后都碰到两个强力敌人，这和SC利贝尔转一圈然后遇到执行者是一个套路；中间的被迫上飞艇简直就是SC神还原；下半部坐红翼去四个灵窟又和四轮之塔很像。事实上，空轨SC虽然是公认轨迹系列最好的一部，评分也最高的作品，但当时的重复绕利贝尔两圈也是有不少人批评的。闪轨2在这一点上放大了SC的缺点，却没有吸收SC的优点。SC虽然有些套路化，但人家主线剧情、人物刻画、细节方面都是一等一的，而且执行者第一次出来也给人神秘感和新鲜感。而在闪轨2，一方面已经经历过SC的套路，另一方面敌方角色不是老面孔，就是毫无塑造的新角色，再加上闪轨2本身剧情非常水，简直是雪上加霜。

闪轨2的剧情有多水？一个好好的内战写的非常小家子气。主角团们一边口口声声说自己是中立方，另一边就完全帮着正规军。关于反派，一开始我已经以为尤西斯的爸爸非常low了，没想到这个贵族联盟的首领凯恩公爵更low，从头到尾不动脑子，被结社和宰相利用自己。其他反派的强力角色基本都是自顾自的行动，只想享受战斗的乐趣，唯一的老大二柱，居然和我说弄出煌魔城只想作为战斗舞台，对凯恩公爵招绯红骑神一点防备都没有？后面更是直接帮主角团，拜托你有点坏人的样子行不？最后的结局也非常突兀，可以说是一点伏笔也没有安排，强行给角色一个幕后身份。总的来说，如果剧情总分是10分，闪轨2大概只有3,4分的样子。

[h1] 人物刻画	[/h1]

这里先谈一谈排列组合这一机制。在这一部中，我终于发现falcom神奇的排列组合是如何制作的了。据我推测，应该是一段剧情中每个人都有一两句话，然后一开始就安排好固定的顺序，按照队伍里人物的有无，来构成对话的结构。这一点和羁绊事件毫无疑问是闪轨人物刻画不力的最大原因。正是因为排列组合，导致剧情中人物对话灌水，因为每个人的对话都要考虑到，每个人就只能说少量话，而且对剧情不能有影响，自然不会让玩家有深刻的印象，也无法好好刻画人物。另一方面，很多对人物重要的剧情都隐藏在了羁绊事件里，导致你不走某人的羁绊，某人就几乎毫无存在感，比如像马奇亚斯，艾略特，劳拉和盖乌斯，游戏中的主线都没有相关剧情，甚至让人觉得他们是多余的。而且因为羁绊事件是支线，自然也就没有什么深刻的内容，充其量也就是让你了解了解这个角色而已。

falcom这么设计有一点是可以很明显看出的，希望玩家能在下周目体验到不同的剧情，进而有进行多周目的动力。排列组合（原谅我还用这个词）是偷懒吗？并不是这样的，就算只用做全队员对话，大量的场景也需要很多的精力，更别说后期很多排列组合对话都有语音，而且的确一些排列组合会出现单人的长对话和双人的联动对话，前者比如劳拉班长菲的剧情，后者也有王女爱丽榭，另外战斗link终结时还有总计18人的双人语音（这个是真的排列组合）。这么一看，falcom是在这方面下了不少功夫。这的确是一个很大的矛盾，要解决这个问题，要么下更多功夫，进一步完善对话内容，要么只能放弃不少的排列组合。但是关于羁绊事件，我觉得falcom真可以放弃了，本身轨迹系列是一个连贯的故事，非得做的像galgame一样，而且实质恋爱元素也很少，人物对话也千篇一律。这因为这些原因，不少人物性格甚至有些崩坏。比如莎拉教官在本作就变成了搞笑角色，而上一部威风凛凛的克蕾雅上尉，这一部就变成了暗恋黎恩的大姐姐？还有就是黎恩和他们的小伙伴们，整天都把“找到自己的路”“为了VII组”“为了找回伙伴”这些话挂在口中，不仅中二，而且根本让人无法感到人物原本的性格。

但比起空洞的主角来说，不少配角还是塑造得不错。比如感情很好的琳黛和薇薇姐妹，比如故乡造到破坏的贝琪。路边的NPC也有不少让人印象深刻，像是照顾琳黛的杂货店婆婆，直到后期去找她依然有关心琳黛和薇薇的对话；比如大市集从被破坏到重建，不少NPC之间的家人、朋友之情也令人感动。但是从我个人来看，闪轨2的NPC刻画比不上东京迷城，东京迷城发生在一个市里，人物之间关系更加紧密，而闪轨2的NPC对话则显得浮于表面。

[h1] 亮眼之处	[/h1]

关于闪轨2的优点，首先明显的就是它的音乐，本作无论是在场景配乐还是OPED上都算是无可挑剔的，不过谈及闪轨2最大的优点是音乐也是一种讽刺。另外本作的战斗系统还算不错，在1代基础上的进一步加强，虽然没有什么难度，无论是黎恩一刀流，永恒喂cp药流还是无限时爆拉人流都可以轻松过关，但是套路还是有许多种的。本作通关我用了92个小时，就是后期有很多时间花在了梦幻回廊，研究18个角色的回路搭配上。其他还值得一提的就是falcom的传统——细节部分。比如最终决战之前去各个地方，基本都有一些有趣的剧情。但本作的细节也救不回空洞的人物刻画。

[h1] 总结	[/h1]

总体来说，闪轨2的确是系列最差没跑了，我也没法说出值得一玩这种话，不过从闪轨3的评价来看，似乎相对于2代有所回升，相必falcom也发现了自己的问题吧。作为轨迹系列玩家，如果抱着发掘闪轨2的槽点这种想法，还是可以试一试这部作品的。

Dragon Cliff 龙崖,schinese,"随缘挂了一段时间，前期看着似乎挺简单，后期要爬塔、解锁了很多新功能以后，发现build还是有很多可能性的，平衡性做得也相当不错，基本算得上是任何时候爆什么好东西就玩什么职业也能打出可观的成绩。
可惜的是，一款挂机游戏想在build的深度上深挖，就必然成也挂机败也挂机。复杂的策略和计算跟很多玩家在挂机游戏里追求的轻松爽爆背道而驰，挂机这种一挂降百会的核心机制也注定会反噬玩家前一阶段布局时的成就感，最终化为一句“那我之前想那么多干嘛”的灵魂疑问，透支玩家对挂机快感的期待，提前带来“然而这一切又有什么意义呢”的那一天。

今年，3月14号加入愿望单，直到夏促6月26号才买下来了这个游戏。

现在是7月1号，游戏时间已经到了60个小时，成就完成了55个（78%的完成率），游戏进度在二周目刚刚打开了混沌异界。

你要说游戏好不好玩，首先得问一下你喜不喜欢这种游戏类型：挂机、费电、模拟经营、[strike]恋爱养成[/strike]……

[b]游戏优点[/b]

就我玩过的挂机类游戏中，游戏性没得说绝对是一流的。[strike]虽然说我也只玩过几个挂机类的手游[/strike]。游戏数值、装备词条、角色特性、升级系统都很完善，抛开数值[spoiler]毕竟挂机游戏就很让人爽的，自然数字什么越大越爽[/spoiler]，其他内容单独拿出来绝对够作为其他游戏中一项值得大吹特吹的点。龙崖呢，它全都有。

[b]游戏缺点[/b]

1. 剧情，要求挂机游戏剧情好是不是在搞事？
2. 配乐单调，不过反正挂机你也不会想听后台 BGM ，问题也不大；
3. 菜单简陋，值得一黑，太简单了，研究半天才发现，原来有些功能是真的没有而不是没有找到；
4. 游戏内教程也简单了一点吧？且不说阵容配置，单独一个伤害数值的转化就够研究好几天。那么那些英雄属性有没有相冲的呀？会不会出现 + buff ，哎呀我不需要这种 buff 的情况也得花很多时间才能弄明白。而且网上的攻略是真的少，幸好通关也不难，效率通关才难；
5. 居然没有下线收益，我甚至想电脑不关机通宵挂机了，这一点一定要差评。

龙崖—模拟经营化的放置游戏

龙崖是一款奇幻像素风的国产“半放置”游戏，某些方面这款游戏做的过好，超出挂机游戏的需要，导致这款游戏，在我看来是有它自己独有的优点，但是作为挂机游戏来说有部分地方是不太合适仍然可以继续改进的。

特点
首先这款游戏不是寻常向的挂机游戏， 正常的挂机游戏是什么样的？拿steam上最火的点击英雄来做例子。点击英雄就是最模版化的挂机游戏，近乎无穷无尽的层数不同的怪物，玩家几乎除了找个合适的层数开始挂机之外什么也不用干，只需要等一段时间靠挂机赚的资源买更厉害的英雄升级即可，完全是数据的提升。当然点击英雄可以用鼠标点击攻击怪物能更提升伤害，可那点伤害完全杯水车薪，毫无意义。

本作则完全不同，一开始甚至你无法自动挂机，强制要手动完成任务后才能解锁自动挂机。而因为本作引导做的太好系统做的对挂机游戏来说过于复杂，随着一步一步解锁新系统功能，游戏的前几个小时几乎是无法挂机的，需要你全手动操作。升级、招募新职业英雄、阵容搭配、冒险团队的技能搭配、天赋选择、提升居民、打造装备卖钱、探索新图、合成分解附魔等等，要认真玩的话完全是没有空闲的时候。

优点
所以很清楚了，本作的优点在哪里？玩家需要自己考虑阵容搭配，天赋加点，装备更新，居民更换等，这样在普通的放置游戏里加入了一定的策略性，而且这个过程是很有趣的，每当你完成后都有新东西给你体验，永远对下一步充满了好奇。玩起来的整体感受像在玩一款RPG，而不是放置游戏。

缺点
本作的缺点在哪里？对于挂机游戏来说这样的体验就不太合适了，普通挂机游戏完全可以做到挂机后，不用管事，等一段时间后切过来点两分钟就OK。龙崖则不一样了，游戏里的钱打怪是无法获得的，必须通过获得的材料打造装备再卖给商店，招募过来的居民也得比较加成进行更换，在游戏不同时期对加成的需求也不一样。这一切的一切都需要花时间，而且还的是算好时间切过来操作。不然积攒的资源又得手动操作花出去消耗。等于做得很好的系统牢牢的拴住了玩家，迫使玩家进行定期量的手动操作，玩起来整体体验反而不像传统的放置游戏。

总结与改进方向的期望
这是一款很棒的半放置游戏，推荐给玩腻了普通放置游戏的玩家尝试一下，这款游戏在普通的放置设定上加入了自己的一些微创新，增添了不少乐趣。另外希望开发者大佬能让有些设定能更“放置化”，比如开放自动打造装备自动卖商店，自动合成等功能，让想“放置”的玩家自行放置玩，想手动自行手动操作。

[h1]时间就是力量[/h1]

[b]关于《龙崖》[/b]
当放置+贩卖道具+素材制作+多职业技能搭配+不同武器装备组合+道具武器角色分等级融和一体，这就是《龙崖》了。当你放置的时间足够，组建最富豪的队伍，远古的全员搭配远古全装装备，在龙崖帝国和异界为所欲为。

[b]【伪·放置】[/b]
作为放置向游戏需要具有不同的方面去吸引游玩者在抛弃游戏操作的时候，还会返回游戏进行下一步。从我开始游戏后，短短一天半的时间让人半玩半挂机了17小时，期间我除开收获挂机后的素材，发现了这个游戏的关于游戏粘度的部分机制，真的设计的太细致了。我几乎在挂机获取一些素材经验的时候不停的返回操作具体内容。
 
[h1]-时间可以给你积累素材，最爽的消费留给玩家自己~[/h1]

这个游戏将枯燥无味的素材积累变成了放置挂机，将获取材料的操作缩减到极致，往往你打开游戏放置了一个工作的时间，就足够你获得让队伍上升台阶的财富素材。
于是玩家只能将精力和时间集中在招纳更好的居民，获取和贩卖更好的道具，在技能和角色上组合的赛选等等。几乎在前期吸引你玩下去的是不断进一步的贪念，比如更好的蓝图制作武器，能够卖出更高的价格，更好的武器想要搭配更好的角色去搭配，以此类推的将玩家一层套一层的乐不此彼。

具体来看就你会在黄色的区域费心升级武器和提高售价；在绿色的区域不断去分手和拥抱大腿；紫色区域去融合燃烧废材企图出现奇迹；红色区域不停对比居民数值和功能，简直处心积虑的令人头大；蓝色书块促使你升级技能进化学院；青色区域去败家饰品。这一层层丧心病狂的圈套，慢慢丰富更多内容去勾引玩家停不下来的去游戏操作让自己变强。

这大概就是龙崖的魅力，时间挂给你爽感的素材，具体怎么爽，可能就要达到你放置时间的一半有余。

[h1]-全幅武装就能称霸天下了么~[/h1]

当游戏逐渐发展到了后期，你开始追逐了角色之间的技能搭配&套路配合，一遍又一遍通关，追求最后任务的大圆满结局，好像总算能够结束了。你好不容易打到了天下太平，以为作为英雄可以休息了，这时候恭喜你解锁了困难模式，发现了远古装备、卷轴、无尽地下城、希望之尘、套装项链等其妙的组合系统，这种提示画面几乎是让人放弃了思考，但是又停止不下的去继续感受新的数据和内容。

[h1]总结：[/h1]
当一款优秀的放置游戏遇见了用心良苦的开发。
从目前的游戏完整程度和游玩体验，我只能说，如果你喜欢一款放置游戏，不喜欢动太多脑子，不妨来试试龙崖。它会让放置游戏没有往日那么无聊，它也没有通常游戏的那么多复杂繁琐，你可以在挂机几小时后，用1小时的时间去爽快享受去转换成力量的快乐。
[b]非常乐意推荐这款游戏，简单又缓慢的放置RPG暗黑地下城无尽爬塔级的龙崖！Rua~[/b]

[i]Ps:其实当游戏发布后众口难调的广大群众是让人最为担心的事情，最难得可贵的是开发的持之以恒。龙崖就像孩子一样，在开发和玩家之间不断成长，你可以在评论区看见提出建议和想法的玩家和开发的简单互动，开发一直在关注着优化的内容，不断提高游戏体验和玩法。[/i]

如果说武器增加套装效果，不失为一种好的策略，但是有可能会极大地固定装备配置，起到反作用，现在的6个格子+3个技能或许还能支撑一段时间，关于技能释放和出手顺序，可否加入阵型系统？
另外金钱用途还可以增加，挂机系统还有的优化。

Dragon Cliff 龙崖,schinese,"感觉第一个坎是在8级刚开困难的时候，装备可以说是能弄到当时最好的8级装备了，9级的也能做出来，但是打不过困难的木林10，在困难不喝药水的话，也没法愉快的刷（效率我觉得还不如普通的）
然后，人物7LV70+，升级需要的经验超级多，技能都学满了，武器和衣服算是LV8的顶了吧，感觉LV9的好像也就是属性提高了而已。，卷轴应该是当时提升最大的东西了吧，但因为需要打稀有材料做，而就算是普通难度的异化LV80+我也打不过，只能挂机，似乎恶魔碎片也是只能手动弄到？
很迷茫，不知道应该向着什么方面提升才能去刷困难10，就只能在普通难度挂机了。希望能让这个阶段平滑一些。",

推荐人群：喜欢骑马与砍杀类型游戏、经营、带兵攻城略地的玩家
测试平台：Steam

+优秀且丰富的经营与攻城玩法（同骑马与砍杀系列）
+丰富的自定义士兵选项

-众多直接影响游戏进程的BUG
-落后的AI
-较落后的画面

整体来说，这部游戏潜力很大，但已经是完整版了，还有众多的BUG和AI落后问题，预计很难改善，还是建议玩家谨慎选购。游戏的模式和《骑马与砍杀》系列如出一辙，玩家开局一点钱一把手枪，凭借努力和才华尝试统一一片大陆，战斗是FPS模式。背景是现代，因此武器全是现代战争枪械，也有简单的武器改装。玩家招募的士兵在装备方面自定义空间很大，玩家可以做出一支完全属于自己的军队。游戏缺点也很明显，常出现敌军在战斗中逃到战场之外，主角无法追击而只能读档的BUG。AI也比较弱智，给友军规划较多行进路线，经常半路卡住不动，敌人也是远距离完全看不见主角，消音狙击枪可以轻松1v30，但只要没有消音，主角开枪后敌人超远距离拿MP5也能把主角往死里打，精准度爆表。另外因为是Unity引擎，且制作组条件有限，画面比较落后。",Xian Dai Zhan Zheng Ban Qi Kan  Ce Shi Ping Tai steam You Xiu Qie Feng Fu De Jing Ying Yu Gong Cheng Wan Fa Tong Qi Ma Yu Kan Sha Xi Lie  Feng Fu De Zi Ding Yi Shi Bing Xuan Xiang  Zhong Duo Zhi Jie Ying Xiang You Xi Jin Cheng De bug Luo Hou De ai Jiao Luo Hou De Hua Mian

Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare,schinese,"忘了多久之前的测试版就入了在玩，潜力真的很高，制作组更新的也很勤快，每次重新玩都可以看到很多的变化（虽然这些变化也未必都是好的，也会伴随着很多奇怪的bug）。后来因为忙的原因，很长时间没有玩，就算前阵子得知脱离EA了，也是最近才有空，以下针对目前的版本做一些很主观的评价。
不得不说移除了兵种升级变化真的是很大的遗憾，目前小兵的起始种类就决定了这个小兵的成长高度，太低级的兵种就意味着最强也就那样，最终只能丢去守城重新雇佣高级兵种来练，这样根本就丧失了把小兵慢慢培养成长的成就感。其次，给每个小兵单独配装表面上看有很丰富的可玩性，但是小兵三两下牺牲了却带来了很大的挫败感，久而久之就是捡到什么装备都排队一键换装，完全没心思再去搭理。
以上是我觉得最难过的地方，其他的设定变动，个人都觉得还过得去，但是我真的觉得目前的游戏开发进度还没到脱离EA的时候，不管是UI还有可玩性，只能说有好有坏。有部分玩家跟我一样希望能有第三人称，我也投第三人称一票，希望制作组考虑（小兵都有阴影，而我还是浮空的一双手）。
BUG方面，战场上敌人的小兵有时候会凭空刷出来对着我就是一顿扫射（真的不是我瞎，已经试过几次了，大白天，一片空地上突然刷出来骑脸输出）。城镇的建设，把建筑拆了之后土地使用数还是没变，反复读档好多次都一样。夜晚的烟雾弹有照明的效果，理论上在晚上的烟雾应该是一团黑什么的看不见的，但是现在烟雾弹的白雾能直接照亮很大一片地方，那些穿梭在烟雾之间的敌人反而更加醒目，这个真的得考虑优化一下。

Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy,japanese,"逆転裁判1を全話、2の第1話までクリアしました。
まだ全作クリアしたわけではありませんが、1だけに限っても、スキップなしで進めて20時間近くはかかる大ボリュームでした。

証言と証拠品の食い違いを探して突きつけ、完全にアリバイを崩したかと思えばまた証言を重ねてきたりと、タイトルどおり有利不利が目まぐるしく変わっていく、怒涛の展開がひたすら熱かったです。
時間制限もないため、どこに食い違いがあるのかじっくり考えることができ、考えがうまく当てはまったときは爽快です。
ぶっちゃけ、セーブ＆ロードの総当たり戦法でクリアできないことはないのですが、やはりちゃんと考えて解きたいところです。

ただ、ゆっくり遊べるけど熱い展開の裁判パートと違って、その前の証拠品探しである探偵パートは、どうも面倒くささが目立ちました。
行ける場所はすべて行き、調べられるものは片っ端から調べて、遭遇した人物が何かヒントをくれるまでひたすら持ち物を突きつけるのは、手間しか感じませんでした。

また、逆転裁判1の第5話だけ、他の話と違って独自の要素がありますが、これも面倒。
見えない血痕を見つけるために、ひたすらマップ中にスプレーを吹き付けたり、とあるアイテムとシルエットの形を一致させるために角度を変えようにも、なかなか一致しなかったり、動画の中にある一瞬しか映らない不審点を見つけないといけなかったり。
あと、ストーリーが異様に長くて、なかなか終わりが見えない。

全体的に、1の第5話以外はおおむね満足でした。
よくこんなトリック思いつくなぁと、ひたすら感心させられます。

Assassin's Creed Odyssey,schinese,"[h1]看风景与当佣兵[/h1]
作为第一次接触《刺客信条》系列的玩家，本作给我的印象比较震撼。之前作为云玩家，印象里刺客都应该是暗杀才对。结果到了古希腊，斯巴达已经和雅典打起了群架。不过也没必要在这点上纠结，[spoiler]《地铁：离去》里也没地铁，《孤岛惊魂5》里还没孤岛呢，[/spoiler]这种系列作品，名称只是对故事背景的交代，不能作为游戏内容来解读，游戏性才是最重要的。

[h1]本作的剧本[/h1]
这部游戏的剧本总体不错。游戏背景为伯罗奔尼撒战争期间，斯巴达与希腊战事胶着。而玩家所扮演的主角作为一名佣兵，要一边响应联盟的召唤，一边寻找亲人。其间还顺带推翻一下神教再收集几个神器。游戏的剧情为半开放，游戏一开始提示了玩家选择的重要性。虽然没有交互电影那么丰富的剧情，但选项也或多或少对结局有一定影响，追求完美结局的玩家务必要重视自己的选择。游戏中的不少支线也有着丰富的剧情，对故事背景还有主线起到补充说明的作用。当然，也少不了育碧的致敬和恶趣味。

[h1]游戏画面[/h1]
游戏的大小高达70G，对于一款18年发售的游戏来说，已经不小了，不过好在这么大的体积，完全对得起它的质量。由于游戏是开放世界，所以环境的质量尤为重要，除了《我的世界》，谁愿意在一个像素般的世界里探索？上手体验后，基本打消了这个顾虑。个人感觉，《刺客信条：奥德赛》的画面质量优于前一年发售的《幽灵行动：荒野》，但细节程度赶不上同年发售的《孤岛惊魂5》，三者同为开放世界，或许跟地图的大小有一定关系，荒野>奥德赛>远哭5。整体细节层次很高，建模很精致，虽然不能避免贴图路面以及贴图草的问题，不过无伤大雅。光影效果非常棒，同时在动态天气系统的支持下，无论是日出还是黄昏，阳光明媚或雷雨交加，画面都很漂亮。游戏背景为古希腊战争，那么环境自然也是希腊群岛。身处在1000倍微缩的希腊群岛之中，航海就变成了重要的成分。游戏虽然不支持光追，但游戏中海面的效果却依旧出色，关闭ui后，截图甚至能以假乱真。

[h1]关于玩法[/h1]
游戏的核心玩法，是育碧自成一派的开放世界+RPG。大概就是从18年起，育碧这种公式化的游戏开始越来越多。RPG是角色扮演游戏，核心应当是扮演，然而到了有些地方，刷刷刷却成了主要内容。说到育碧RPG的这套等级系统，或许不同的人有自己不同的看法。不过就我个人而言，我不太喜欢。有些玩家，比如我，有时不愿在同一款游戏上花费过多时间，因此喜欢快速通过主线。但在育碧的RPG系统下，等级不够成了挡住你继续主线的门槛。为了等级和装备，玩家不得不完成支线或其他挑战。不过就像前面提到的，或许是育碧发现了刷支线的无聊，《刺客信条：奥德赛》的支线中也加入了丰富的剧情。只不过有了丰富的剧情之后，支线依旧是公式化的任务。个人认为，强行延长了玩家的游戏时间，也不见得是什么好事，也许更丰富的主线剧情会更吸引人。

游戏中有一个独特的系统，玩家可以直接或间接的参与到希腊与斯巴达的战斗中去。当你选择与其中一方结盟时，在另一方的领地中搞破坏可以降低其国力，而国力降低到一定程度后，玩家可以参与到一场征服战当中去，获胜者将获得这里的领地。这个系统使得玩家能够亲身参与到历史上这场浩荡的战争中去，这可能是原本的目的。只是到了最后玩家会发现，即使你极力参与到战争中去，也不能完全掌控战争全局，有时玩家夺得的土地，可能在一则提示之后，就物归原主了。而你奋勇杀敌，和你结盟的那一方联盟也不会引发什么剧情，只是给你一件装备奖励。一个新颖的设计最后变成了刷装备的副本，有些差强人意。

游戏中还有一个悬赏系统。当玩家为了资源而干出杀人或偷盗的行为，会被他人出钱挂上悬赏。悬赏状态下，会有其他佣兵来取玩家性命，悬赏等级越高，前来的佣兵也就越强大。杀死佣兵并不能消除悬赏，玩家只能选择躲避追杀等待消除悬赏，付钱消灾，或者冒险杀死提出悬赏的人。这个系统也在一定程度上限制了玩家的行为和发展，又或者说这个系统本身就是一套刷装备的副本。玩家可以做守法好公民，清理支线来提升等级，也可以与佣兵硬刚，做一个烧杀劫掠的强盗，只不过风险较高。

游戏中的海战系统比较有意思。因为要考船只探索环境，就免不了战斗，无论是与佣兵还是海盗。海战中，玩家可以通过射箭（远程）或者掷矛（贴脸）来攻击敌方船只，敌人也一样。不过玩家也可以通过极高的航速，撞向敌人，造成高额伤害。当敌人的船只血量降低到一定程度，玩家就会有两个选项。用船的撞角把对方的船只撞成两节，这场面十分壮观。又或者贴脸登船，亲自杀光对面船只上的敌人。前者可以为船只回复额外的血量，而后者可以掠夺额外的战利品。两者不光是游戏体验上的不同，还有战略上的区别，需要考虑到自身需求选择。

说到最后，《刺客信条：奥德赛》整体是一部不错的游戏。不过较长的游戏流程，对非深度玩家来说可能是一个挑战。育碧虽然也有不少毛病，但游戏水准不能否认。在这部游戏里除了精彩的游戏体验，也能有不错的视觉体验。育碧的开放世界，虽然跑腿累了一点，但风景着实漂亮。说到这里不得不吐槽育碧的开放世界，在《刺客信条》里，主角会爬墙，所以爬山不是问题。但其他的开放世界里，悬崖真的是要人命[spoiler]一名《孤岛惊魂》和《幽灵行动》的受害者如是说道[/spoiler]。

STEINS;GATE 0,russian,Отличная визуальная новелла,otlichnaia vizual'naia novella
STEINS;GATE 0,schinese,"游戏流程好长啊...这是我首先想说的
先自己通了一遍,再跟着攻略打完所有结局,花了三十多个小时.

0和一代一样还是一样的精彩，不过相比于第一代，0的故事结构，音乐和立绘都有很大的不同。算是一种新的体验吧。

像之前有人问我，这一部是第一部的前传还是后传，我想了想，是 插传， 所以我觉得在不了解命运石之门第一部游戏版的真结局或者动画版的结局的情况下，不适合玩这一部，因为插哪你都不知道，最后暗示性的真结局可能不太好理解。

既然说到动画版了，再说说命运石之门0的动画版，相较于动画版第一部只保留真结局主线的剧情安排，0的动画版则是删删改改融合了游戏的所有内容才呈现出来的，是好是坏大家可以各执己见，我也不想讨论。
我想说的是0游戏版里不同于上一作的故事结构，第一部的结局偏向galgame，主角伦太郎和每一个人物在一起就是一个结局，而0的每个结局都是整个故事的一部分，从故事性上来讲，这样的作法无疑是高级的，因为玩家在这个结局得到信息可以带入下一个结局去帮助自己更透彻的理解，这使得每个故事都更加有意义。只是这些故事线大部分是相互独立的，所以应该会给动画版的融合带来一些难度吧。

立绘方面我觉得没什么好说的，我喜欢第一代多点。

音乐虽然都换了，但是和原作一样保持了简单悠扬又抓耳的风格。

这一代的成就和剧情分支选项，都是比较简单的，从头到尾发消息聊天的内容对成就和剧情没有一点影响，这一点我觉得有点失去第一代的乐趣之一了。其次一开始我对世界线偏移的方式充满了困惑，我以为0的逻辑性大不如前，后来我发现自己错了，剧情上的各种安排仍然是合理且自洽的。

最后再说说命运石之门的惯用设定----跳跃式的硬科幻
从弦理论和脑科学直接跳跃到时间跳跃机
从人工智能的基准理论和脑科学直接跳跃到Amadeus

想想还挺搞笑的，就像我刚明白小鸡是从蛋里孵出来的突然跳跃到宫保鸡丁
刚学会输出Hello World和组装电脑突然跳跃到系统开发。
当然我不是说这个不行，确实是挺有意思的。

0中伦太郎的视界更加的宏大，游戏对未来的描绘也更加具象，游戏保持了一如既往的高水准，当然想和第一代比肩的话，我觉得还差那么一点儿点儿，欸嘿。",You Xi Liu Cheng Hao Chang A Zhe Shi Wo Shou Xian Xiang Shuo De  Cha Chuan  Li Hui Fang Mian Wo Jue De Mei Shi Yao Hao Shuo De Wo Xi Huan Di Yi Dai Duo Dian  Zui Hou Zai Shuo Shuo Ming Yun Shi Zhi Men De Guan Yong She Ding Tiao Yue Shi De Ying Ke Huan  Cong Xian Li Lun He Nao Ke Xue Zhi Jie Tiao Yue Dao Shi Jian Tiao Yue Ji  Gang Xue Hui Shu Chu hello worldHe Zu Zhuang Dian Nao Tu Ran Tiao Yue Dao Xi Tong Kai Fa  Dang Ran Wo Bu Shi Shuo Zhe Ge Bu Xing Que Shi Shi Ting You Yi Si De 
STEINS;GATE 0,schinese,"正如标题曲《Rewake》的意思一般，SG0 讲述的是伦太郎在亲手杀死红莉茜后自甘堕落绝望，再到与真帆炭等其他人相遇，相知，化解危机，最后重新苏醒为凤凰院凶真，寻找命运石之门拯救两人的故事。
[spoiler] 相比SG本篇对于相对论的和时间的论述，本作更加着重刻画了人工智能的发展前景，并且引入了“Amadeus”作为红莉茜的代表出场。需要解决的危机也由拯救真由氏~变为阻止暗流涌动的世界各国机关围绕时间机器和人工智能“Amadeus”的战争与纷扰。相比之下，故事与设定上没解释清楚的漏洞就更加的多了。比如既然世界上这么多人都有命运探知的能力，那么就相当于对同一条世界线上有复数个观测者（神），那么观测者任意一人做出世界线变动的举动，其他人也会注意到世界线变动，记忆疯狂重叠早就疯了吧hhh；还有伦太郎从2036年跳回来的时候，中间有11年没拿手机，怎么跳？还有萌郁和FB的关系，在游戏最开始的时候成谜，为什么她开始正常上班采访？并且暗地里接调查员的活？后来为啥又在给FB卖命了？[/spoiler]

（基于本传良好的理论基础铺垫，0的剧情展开更加大胆发散，节奏有张有弛，烧脑而过瘾）
+人物刻画生动，内心戏丰富
（新老人物非常多，关系网络交错，且由于世界线的不同，立场、心态、行为都会发生改变）
+依旧出色的声优演出
（日常和非日常，不同情境不同情绪都表演得很好）
+逻辑自恰的设定
（还是类似于“薛定谔的猫”的理论，观测的结果才是已定的现实，连接可能性吧，去欺骗世界吧）
（时间穿越相关作品读者第一件事就是要摒弃“先有鸡还是先有蛋”的问题，逻辑成立因果闭环即可）

这是放弃了助手的β世界线，第三次世界大战将会爆发，伦太郎能否在绝望中找到通往Steins Gate的大门呢
不用说，自然是找到了的，但知道结局并不影响0的精彩程度，不同于本传的单线“中途下车”分结局的形式，0的故事讲述相当发散，不同的情况和条件导向完全不同的结局，人物关系与立场也不总是一定的，非SG线的结局导向很难预先猜中，且没有本传的Time Leap，时间线一直是向前的，一个小纰漏就会引发不可挽回的后果，带来一份压迫与紧张（不过轻松日常的穿插调剂也很出色）
0的叙事方法，带给玩家最奇妙的感受就是对于伦太郎的代入感，在同一攻略线上，玩家始终与冈伦保持几乎同样的信息，开始时都有α世界线记忆，冈伦的痛苦只有玩家能懂。世界线变动后，玩家与冈伦都获得了额外的信息，而后世界线再次变动，先前的信息无效，同时缺失现在世界线的信息，这种混乱感是相同的。再进一步，玩家拥有其他攻略线的记忆，高于冈伦应掌握的信息，世界线的错乱感更甚，玩家不由得停下来思考，梳理人物关系和线路差异，找到影响到达SG线的真正条件，这就好像是玩家自己也找到了最后的答案
同时这些迥异的角色线也丰满了人物形象，其中的一个因果闭环设计我甚是喜欢，还有自知或不自知的亲子日常也相当奇妙有趣~

最后是站队时间，Maho颜艺担当好萌好萌~在动画里就更萌更萌了",Qu Qi Pian Shi Jie Ba  Geng Jia Shao Nao Jing Cai De Ju Qing  Ren Wu Ke Hua Sheng Dong Nei Xin Xi Feng Fu  Yi Jiu Chu Se De Sheng You Yan Chu  Ri Chang He Fei Ri Chang Bu Tong Qing Jing Bu Tong Qing Xu Du Biao Yan De Hen Hao  Luo Ji Zi Qia De She Ding

顺便说一下，是我取了“命运石之门”（Steins Gate）这个名字。为什么要去“命运石之门”这个名字，你应该知道
“没有什么意义”。对吗？
我说明一下最终任务，代号“掌管未来的女神”（Operation Skuld）的作战概要
“不改变确定的过去，而改变结果”
去欺骗“最初的你”。
去欺骗、世界。
这就是为了达到“命运石之门”所做的选择

[h1]游戏简评[/h1]
画面上依然采用独特和熟悉的画风，跟前作一模一样。由季是真的好看鸭~桶子你个混蛋！这作CG感觉进步了好多啊，CG随便一截图就是一张好图。吹爆。还有手机变成了智能机，短信也变了RINE，表情包萌死了鸭。
音乐上也依然出色，出色的制作，熟悉的旋律，配乐的时机把握得非常好，真结局的ED好听，英日结合。
最后要讲剧情了，因为本作的剧情是关联着前作的，所以没有玩过前作或者看过《命运石之门》动画的请先去游玩或者欣赏吧，游戏剧情建立在前作的最后放弃拯救牧濑红莉栖的基础上，所以游戏的文本整个过程基本都是一个在沉重压抑的氛围下推进的，与前作对比有一点点改变的是，本作有相当一部分剧情是以非男主角冈部伦太郎的视角进行的，比如：比屋定真帆、阿万音铃羽等，本作对比前作更加侧重伦太郎外的角色描写，目的是使玩家更加容易理解故事的细节跟发展，也起到了推动剧情发展的作用。本作在剧情的逻辑性与严谨性上更是下足了功夫，伏笔连连，细节做得很到位，前后的剧情链接得非常好，前后两部作品结合起来补全了整体剧情。详细剧情内容怕被剧透警告，这里就不细说了，总结来说，剧情总体依然是非常优秀，神作啊！我TM吹爆好吗。个人感觉是最棒的文字冒险游戏。[spoiler] 题外话，动画我有看，不过剧情被魔改了，剧情上感觉存在着些许的漏洞bug，还有动画里时间（日期）与事件好像对不上，细节也缺了不少，毕竟动画是被压缩了的，如果有说错请dalao轻喷，总得来说我还是推荐玩游戏，当然你喜欢动画我也不强求，毕竟这是个人的兴趣爱好与自由。[/spoiler]
[h1] 总结[/h1]
[b] 游戏目前暂时没有中文，贴吧应该有汉化吧，dalao也可以选择选择英文文本加日语语音攻略，但是很快应该就更新中文了⑧。最后，至于游戏，我是强烈推荐的，别看120块以为很贵，其实买到就是赚到，打折入手更是赚爆好吗。[/b]",Shun Bian Shuo Yi Xia Shi Wo Qu Liao Ming Yun Shi Zhi Men steins Mei You Shi Yao Yi Yi Dui Ma  skuldDe Zuo Zhan Gai Yao  Bu Gai Bian Que Ding De Guo Qu Er Gai Bian Jie Guo  Qu Qi Pian Zui Chu De Ni  Qu Qi Pian Shi Jie  Zhe Jiu Shi Wei Liao Da Dao Ming Yun Shi Zhi Men Suo Zuo De Xuan Ze  Shi Jie Neng Bei Qi Pian  Lian Jie Ke Neng Xing Ba  Qu Qi Pian Shi Jie Ba  b Zhu Ni Hao Yun Kuang Qi De Feng Kuang Ke Xue Jia Yo el psy congroob b

Void Bastards,japanese,"エイリアンはびこる廃棄宇宙船内を探索してアイテム探しをしつつ、星系からの脱出を試みるローグライクFPS。アメコミのようなコミカルな絵柄が特徴的。

宇宙マップでは、宙域内にさまよう数々の廃棄船が表示されているので、その中の１つを選んで移動する。それぞれの廃棄船はどういう状況で、どのエイリアンがいて、どういうアイテムが入手できるのかがあらかじめ見ることができる。友好的なエイリアンがいるなどの自分に有利な条件の船もあれば、停電していたり、大火事になっていたりと不利な条件の船もある。また船とは別に、海賊や宇宙クジラなどの移動する障害もある。それらのさまざまな条件を見極めつつ、行き先を決める。

船内マップは複数の部屋がドアや通路でつながっている。この部屋の構成はランダムではなく、船の種類ごとにいくつかのパターンがあり、その中のどれか、ということになる。船内ではエイリアンを撃退しつつ、お金や素材、食料やアイテムを入手していくことになる。部屋には、管制室や電源室などそれぞれに応じた設備を持つ部屋がある。設備をうまく活用することで、アイテムの場所を早期に特定したり、警備システムを無効化したりと、船内探索を円滑に進めることができる。ただし多くの設備の利用にはお金を支払わなければならない。特にアイテム入手のための鍵開けにお金が必要となるため、無駄遣いは厳禁。そのあたりのリソース管理も重要となってくる。

敵やアイテムの絵は3Dではなく、板に描いたような絵がパタパタと動くちょっと変わった表現なので、最初はちょっと戸惑うかもしれない。動きは多少カクカクして見えるが、これはこれで斬新。しかしちゃんとヘッドショットなどもあるので、FPSとしての部分はきちんとしている。

船内で集めた部品や素材を組み合わせて、新たな武器やアイテムを作っていく。これがかなり重要で、武器によって戦いやすさや行動力が極端に変わる。どの武器がどの敵に有利か、は実際に体験しながら覚えていく。武器作成だけでなく、武器強化の中にも重要なものがある。また弾数がわりとシビアで、特に序盤は無駄弾を撃っているとあっという間に弾切れを起こしてしまう。弾数無制限や近接攻撃などといったぬるいものはないので、とにかく弾を大事に。敵はテレポーターから無限に発生するので、なるべくはやく探索を終え、スルーできる敵はかわしたり、部屋に閉じ込めたりして戦闘を極力減らす努力も必要となってくる。

キャラクターはすべて乾燥の刑に処されていた犯罪者で、水で戻された後半強制的に任務につかされる。各キャラはゲーム開始時に独自の特徴を持っている場合がある。また船の設備やイベントでその特徴を増やしたり減らしたりもできる。良い特徴もあれば悪い特徴もあり、そのあたりは運次第。死亡時はまた別の犯罪者が乾燥から戻されて業務に当たるが、お金と食料以外の入手したアイテムはすべて持ち越されるのでご心配なく。ただしゲームモードによっては徐々に宇宙が荒廃していき、タイムリミットがあるので注意。

マップは完全にランダムではないとはいえ、ランダム性が高く、同時にプレイヤー自身の知識や成長によるところも多いゲームなので、何度も遊べる。クリアすることで新たなゲーム設定も選択できるようになり、まったく違ったルールの中で遊ぶこともできる。日本語完全対応なので遊びやすい。

もちろん生存確率を無視するような環境（放射能まみれなど）や凶悪な敵のある船（スクリューと仲良くしたいとは思わないだろう）は無視することも選択に入る
残念なことはエンディングが一つだけってことか・・・ランダム風味ホラーなサバイバルシューターゲームが好きで、少々いじめられても文句がないならそこそこ楽しめると思う

GOD EATER 3,japanese,"「God Eater」シリーズ5作目となる狩猟アクション。

シリーズ初プレイ。購入から1年放置後、フレンドと4人でプレイし、追加エピソード含むストーリーを35時間掛けてクリアしました。
追加エピソードの他、道中に出現したフリーミッションも武器強化の為にやっていますが、それ以外のコンテンツは少し触った程度であまり手付けていません。
NPCと共にソロでプレイすれば30時間ぐらいでクリアできると思います。

人口に関しては平均人口100人前後もおらず、MHWのように野良で他プレイヤーと一緒に遊ぶことは期待しない方が良いかと。
値段が定価9000円とおま値で約3500円ほど他国より高く、セール時4500円でも1500円高いのも注意が必要です。

結論としては、クリアまで遊んでみて他人に勧められるかと言われると全くそう思わないし、次回作がSteamでリリースされても正直やりたいとはならないです。
MHWを遊んだ影響もありそうですが、本当色んなところでストレスが溜まって途中から遊んでてしんどかったです。

ざっと挙げるだけでも以下の通り。
・ストーリーミッション1つクリアする度に入る飛ばせないムービー
・一生視界に入ってくる邪魔臭いフィム
・初回起動時に今までのアプデ内容を全部読ませられるヒント
・あまりにも臭すぎる厨二病な物語展開
・常に胸か尻が中心に表示される故に会話に集中できないカメラワーク
・魅力を感じないアラガミの数々（ラーとピトー以外覚えてない）
・色違いかデザイン違いのかさ増しなガムテープペタペタ衣装
・極たまにBGMがでか過ぎて会話が聞こえないバグ
・MHWとは雲泥の差を感じる操作性の悪さとオプション周りの自由度の無さ
・ホストがミッションを受注してしまうと見えない敵の名前と弱点
・他プレイヤーが集まらない故に実質クリア不可な強襲討伐ミッション
・ムービーで足止めさせるくせに本編クリアがチュートリアルな仕様
・感動もクソもない知らん奴が中心に立つエンドカード等のエンドロール周り
・本編クリア後に使えるとかいう意味不明なキャラリメイク機能
・ゲーム内データベース等から確認しても全く分からないアラガミの素材と武器強化に必要な素材名

ただ、戦闘面はそれなりに面白かったです。8つの武器種は独自の戦い方を持ち合わせていて、ジャンプ攻撃やステップ攻撃、装備するバーストアーツによって攻撃モーションやアクションが変化するのでMHWよりもスピーディー且つ新鮮。
武器種問わず銃やシールドを使用でき、銃はカスタムバレットを設定すれば色んな攻撃方法を編み出せるのは特徴的で良かったです。

今回はあまり使用する機会はなかったものの、PTに組み込める各NPCを軽くカスタマイズ出来る要素や、ソロ限定の追加エピソードなども用意されていました。
キャラメイクも自由度が高く、かっこいいのも可愛いのも両方作れますが、年上お姉さんやイケメンおじさん等は難しかったです。
それにストーリー的に重要な部分はアニメーションで描かれており、作画が良いアニメのようで割と感動しましたね。

全体的に良いところあれど、それを潰すには十分過ぎる悪い部分が多々あり、残念な作品他ならないです。
仮にソロで遊んでいたら絶対バッドレビューを付けていたと思います。それぐらい悪いところが目立ちました。

GOD EATER 3,schinese,船舱的互动有点简陋。出去就是刷本，每一个关卡进出也相当频繁。回来了就是一大堆对话。要么看它啰哩啰嗦长篇大论一整段CG要么直接全部跳过，很尴尬。当中不能快进对话，给我的感受就是漫长。地图和敌人重复度也很高。许多目标和任务地点都是同一个场景。但确实可以算的上是快节奏的动作游戏，包括冲刺，闪避，跳跃攻击，释放缔约，武器招式动作，近远武器切换都很流畅。它也有很多看似非常合理的配点及武器搭配。一个是数量多，一个是制作所需的材料多。此外队友也不再是路人。都有自己的技能升级和选择。很复杂，很肝！如果有足够的耐心和时间多的可以考虑玩玩。往后很多内容例如剧情之类的也会持续更新。这游戏并不算太差。只不过被相似的一些专业讨伐怪物的游戏给秒杀了。,

GOD EATER 3,schinese,"刚推出就入手了，拿到手上还是有不少欣喜的，画面表现、人物塑造、剧情推进、背景音乐、战斗手感，都有着许多可圈可点之处。细节方面，对国区玩家很友好，中文字幕翻译比较走心，优化也比较出色，小优点也是多多，是一款上乘之作。从我个人角度说非要提什么不满的话，那就是地图的重复利用程度偏高，很多战斗会反复在几个小地图里面进行，不禁让我感觉格局有些偏小。

我最喜欢的地方是这款游戏的主角设置，全剧情代入感良好，比较安静沉稳的类型。温馨提示，主角有着比较出色的捏人系统，不是很多大型网游那种每个细节都可以捏的类型，但是让我爱不释手。由于制作组的关系，这个移交到手的新组明显在塑造/刻画女性角色上面的功夫，要优于男性角色。所以，如果你把自己捏成一个漂亮小姐姐的形象，那演出效果就很拔群了，整部下来主角简直就是一个温柔恬静的女神好吗？美的不要不要的……

Age of Empires: Definitive Edition,english,"Age of Empires II is a built up, vastly improved version of Age of Empire and everyone knows this. It's been a running meme for years how AoE2 made its predecessor completely obsolete the day it came out. Starcraft is vastly different than Starcraft 2 and there's reasons to play both. Even the first Company of Heroes is different enough from Company of Heroes 2. But Age of Empires 1 feels like an early beta of 2. I bought the remastered version, played it a few hours - it's very pretty, but mostly just made me want to play the second one (definitive edition).",age empires is a built up vastly improved version age empire everyone knows its been a running meme for years howmade predecessor completely obsolete day it came out starcraft is vastly different than starcraftres reasons to play both even first company heroes is different enough from company heroesbut age empiresfeels like an early betai bought remastered version played it a few hours its very pretty but mostly just made me want to play second one definitive edition

Wolfenstein: Youngblood,schinese,"枪械手感、世界观设定继承前作，上手起来并不复杂。
收集要素解锁原画、概念图。背景故事录音带以及「3D 眼镜」，有那么点儿意思。


主线剧情实在是短。当然了，售价也减半了，首发不到 200 摆明了不是个标准体量的 3A FPS，勉强能接受。但剧情也的确没什么新意。
地图就那么几个大的片区。实际玩儿起来，除了关键主线支线会解锁新的甚至唯一的区域以外，由于 RPG、开放世界等元素的引入，大部分区域是重复的。甚至还引入了日常周常任务，就明确告诉你要反复刷，升级、解锁技能。重复造访相同区域除了能更熟悉行路线、知道敌人在哪里刷新这点优势以外，审美疲劳的副作用相对影响更大，加上华丽而单调的红黑配色，简直了。

武器的设计本身是不错的，但由于 rpg 系统的限制，一部分武器由于 dps 低，破甲能力差，越到后面越没有掏出来的必要了。没有什么是一发破坏神解决不了的，一发不行就两发，两发不行就三发。三发还不够，还有电枪。蛋锤枪，反正不用冲锋枪。和手枪。

从第一次进游戏就被要求注册一个 bethesda 账户，之后每次启动游戏还要验证登陆状态。不知道是不是为了验证「远程同乐」的权限，限制滥用。但是 bethesda 想多了，这个游戏不是所有人都有耐性两个人合作到通关的，我就是只和哥们儿联了一次机之后，独自走完了后面的旅程……

总体，最多最多给个 6.7/10，真的不能再多了。一杯白开水一样，玩儿完就忘了它吧。实在不甘心，就把前作再打一遍。

Wolfenstein: Youngblood,japanese,"[h1]FPS。日本語対応。[/h1]
COOP（二人プレイ）を前提とした作りとなっているが、相方をNPCとしてソロプレイも可能。

[b]【ストーリー】[/b]
父であるブラスコビッチを探すため、パリを舞台にパワースーツを身に着けた娘2人が力を合わせてナチスと戦う。
ブラスコビッチ夫婦から厳しい教育を受けてきたような描写が冒頭ムービーにあるにも関わらず、ストーリー全体で二人ともチャラチャラと頭の良くなさそうな態度をとっている。そのため、二人に共感できず、ストーリー全体に重みがない。

[b]【戦闘】[/b]
基本的にいつものWolfenstein。ただ、ハンドガンとマシンピストル以外二丁持ちできず、爽快感に欠ける。また、マップ移動（ドアの開閉）の際、必ず相方と協力する必要があるのだが、これがスキップ不可なため非常にテンポが悪い。
大型の敵には弱点があるほか、アーマーが2種類あり、それに合った武器を使わないと最低難易度でも敵が結構硬い。
武器はアップグレード可能で、精度（HS）・連射・威力いずれかに特化した武器に出来る。ただ、敵が硬く、すぐ弾切れになるため大抵の人は威力特化に落ち着くと思う。
二人が身に着けているスーツは透明化が可能で、敵に見つかっていない状態で伏せたりすると、味方も自動で透明化する。敵に警報を鳴らされず隠密プレイでミッションを進めるとボーナスが貰える。

[b]【システム】[/b]
準オープンワールドであり、自由にマップを散策できる。
とはいっても、マップが細かく分断されているのであまり広く感じないし、サイドミッションではメインミッションと同じところに何度も行かされるのでボリュームのかさ増し感が強い。
マップごとに特色がなく変わり映えしないのもマイナス。

[b]【味方AI】[/b]
ソロでプレイする場合当然味方はAIとなる。味方AIは決して賢いとは言えず、高難易度では敵に突っ込んで勝手に瀕死状態になったりする。ソロプレイではなく二人プレイを前提にしているため、味方AIに指示を出すこともできない。これが災いして、ラスボスは[spoiler] 後ろから攻撃する必要があり、片方が気を引く必要があるにも関わらず、味方がプレイヤーに近づいてくるため、
[/spoiler] まともに攻略できない。（若干のネタバレあり）

[b]【総評】★★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆　特に魅力のないWolfenstein[/b]
爽快感に欠け、キャラやストーリーに魅力がない。糞ゲーでは全くないが、褒めるところも特にない。
実績関係が長時間の周回プレイを前提としているが、それをする気力が湧かない。そんなゲーム。",bsutorib bZhan Dou b bshisutemub Zhun opunwarudodeariZi You nimatsupuwoSan Ce dekiru bWei Fang aib spoiler matomoniGong Lue dekinaiRuo Gan nonetabareari bZong Ping  Te niMei Li nonaiwolfensteinb

Persona 4 Golden,schinese,"[h1]时光的流逝，就在一个选择[/h1]
女神异闻录系列，在PS平台可谓是不得不玩的游戏之一。本作女神异闻录4与前作有没有什么关联我不清楚，但可以肯定的是没有玩过前作，也完全可以游玩本作。本作的玩法比较特殊，往往在一个时间段，玩家只能做出一个选择，虽然很贴心的给玩家准备了联网可以参照其他玩家，但对于初上手的玩家来讲，总是有那么点懵逼的。一个选择，一段时光的流逝，想后悔？那就只能读盘了。日子就这么一天天的推进，不会因为玩家的一个选择而停留，当然，你暂停游戏还是么的问题。

[h1]贞子你别来了，我们找聊聊天[/h1]
神秘事件作为故事的开端已经屡见不鲜，但是这个头可以开的如此精彩，也是着实的少见。这不，几个熊孩子仗着自己有了超能力，就天天玩穿越，别的穿越都是当个王爷当个娘娘啥的，这里面的穿越，却是为了拯救他人。每逢雨夜的深夜电视，总是会出现那么点奇葩的情形，迷失在里世界的人总是要面对自己内心最深处的自己，而玩家也需要通过击败其他人的负面情绪来拯救他人。但救人归救人，这日子还得过对不，所以本作除了战斗相关的剧情，竟然还有着颇为有趣的日常来填充普遍RPG缺少的这些空白。

[h1]选哪个？小孩子才做选择题的好伐[/h1]
在游戏中，玩家不管是到了哪一个阶段，都要做出N多选择。从玩家刚开始游戏，就得做出如何去回答别人的问候，到与别人交流也要选择自己想要说的话，会影响结局那也就罢了，问题这游戏还有着能力方面的设定。和人交流，你得有表达力吧，想要去帮助别人，你得有包容力吧，要做出一些决定，你还得有勇气，想做一件事做好，你就得有毅力，考试想考好，你还得有知识。这些能力提升，除了玩家可以在做某些事情时会提升之外，就只有再对话的时候慎重选择。不过游戏毕竟比较老了，这攻略可不就随手一翻就有了咩？所以啦，能加多少加多少，管理好自己的时间才是真正的王道。毕竟……还有10多个社团（10级最高/每个）也需要耗费时间来维系，所以我们都是朱朝阳，没毛病。

[h1]这迷宫有点长[/h1]
作为一款RPG游戏，那么战斗什么的，肯定是必不可少的了，不然真就可以当GAL来看了（可以追老婆哦~可以后宫哦~）。本作的战斗说俗套一点就是咱们很多玩家看不惯的回合制战斗。通过不停的替换人格（问啥人格的，进游戏就知道了），合成新的人格，与玩家本身的角色属性搭配，发挥最强的实力。就是游戏的这个迷宫以及经验，实在是让人有点脑仁疼。冗长的迷宫还附带随机变化，每一次探索都会变成不同的地图，这就让想跑剧情的跑断腿，喜欢刷的乐开怀。到后期，每几层就会有一个暂存点（基本就是3层），玩家可以从该层继续探索。只是这每一次探索都要耗费一次时间，又有谁舍得天天跑迷宫不去干点别的？

[h1]这个模型有点怪[/h1]
既然是日式RPG游戏，那么我们都知道游戏的立绘与角色，往往都会有一定的差距。但像本作一样离谱的，也是实属少见。游戏人物角色设定的非常好，画风相当对我口味。甚至中途插播的动画CG，也是相当不错的。而到了实际人物之后……你就会明白什么叫封面仅供参考，请以实物为主。也许是年代问题，2008年的游戏（真的，12年前的）做成这样，也确实不易了，只是个人实在无法接受这个奇葩的大头娃娃（非Q版娃娃）。

总结：说了这么多，该推荐还是推荐，毕竟个人不喜欢的地方才多少啊，是不。如果你可以忍受这个画面（大头娃娃真的有毒）与冗长的迷宫练级，那么本作绝对是RPG游戏爱好者的一大福利，相信多数玩家会爱不释手。游戏会随着搞笑又严肃的日常，枯燥的迷宫不知不觉间就过去。多周目多结局的设定也是让人沉浸，着迷，感兴趣，也能接受画面的玩家，就赶紧入手吧~

柚子社，废萌之集大成者也。


[h1]前言[/h1]
《千恋＊万花》是柚子社与十周年之际推出的一款和风恋爱题材galgame。本作在画面，系统，UI，音乐，剧情以及配音上都有着出众的表现。虽然剧情还是略显平淡，当这并不影响本作展现出每个女主的魅力与萌点。在此感谢Hikari Field[spoiler]氢氟酸[/spoiler]与猫猫社的努力，让这款[strike]实用的[/strike]神作登录steam，期待柚子社后续的作品也可以登录steam。


[h1]附带魔幻色彩的日常[/h1]
故事讲述了为了帮外公打理旅馆的男主有地将臣回到了阔别多年的故乡穗织。将臣在参观神刀时竟将本不可能拔出的神刀丛雨丸拔了出来。于是，男主不仅邂逅了丛雨丸的管理者幼刀，还不得已接下了与巫女大人的婚约,开始了[spoiler]伪[/spoiler]同居生活.伴随着故事的发展，揭开小镇数百年以来的秘密，也开启了男主的恋爱喜剧。


[h1]优秀的系统与收藏功能[/h1]
本作采用了树状流程图，让玩家在攻略的时候就显得非常方便，在完成一条线路之后可以顺利得跳转到其他线路上，省去了很多因为忘记存档导致的ctrl时间。在游戏中也有丰富的设置选项，比如手势功能，触碰按键以及常规的调整人物语言大小的设定，可谓是面面俱到，给玩家一个最佳体验。本作的语音收藏功能也相当实用，可将收藏的语言按照自定顺序来进行播放，妈妈再也不用担心喜欢的声音只能听一遍啦。（笑


[h1]精致的立绘，呆萌的SD与独特的配乐[/h1]
本作的立绘依然延续了柚子社之前的特色，这标志性的描边与上色，一看就让人明白，这肯定是柚子社的作品。本作的sd也画得相当传神，呆萌可爱，不少都成为了QQ表情包中的一部分。
本作的BGM一改钢琴曲的操作，创意性得引入了日本的传统乐器三味线，让其作品的和风气息更加浓烈。


[h1]棱角分明的人物形象[/h1]
游戏中的四位主要女主都有着鲜明的性格特色，也有着各自的烦恼。虽然个人线的套路非常常规，基本就是男主“斩断”各个女主的心魔，得到救赎，最后有情人终成眷属~不过，即使是意料之中的剧情，在攻略的道路上也是糖味十足，甜到爆炸。不过剧本在发糖的同时也不忘进行关联，每个个人线背后的故事都有着千丝万缕的联系，都追溯到了小镇古老的传说之上，以恋结缘，真是如此。

朝武芳乃（CV:遥空）
本作的呆萌担当。作为一名性格认真的巫女大人，芳乃从小就肩负这一份重大的责任，承受这先辈留下的诅咒，这也导致她看起来对人对事都很冷漠，其实内心世界是非常丰富的，渴望交更多的朋友，可惜奈于自己的身份只能处处装作一副泰然自若的样子。所幸男主为其打开心墙，解开了其余母亲之间的误解，斩断了诅咒，最后弄巧成拙，假戏真做。

蕾娜·列支敦瑙尔（CV: 泽泽砂羽）[spoiler]其实我是华哥啦[/spoiler]
本作的人来疯担当。[spoiler]兼职巨乳担当[/spoiler]作为一名北欧女孩，蕾娜身上散发一股开朗活泼的气质，[spoiler]口头禅fxxking[/spoiler]为人也是率真善良。在其个人线中，除了发糖，更多的是解释之前的传说，解释女神，丛雨丸以及朝武先辈之间的联系。

常陆茉子（CV：小鸟居夕花）[spoiler]茉子天下第一[/spoiler]
本作的小恶魔担当。看起来是个经验老到的情场高手，其实只是渴望初恋的自卑女生。因从小接受教育，将生活重心全部放在照顾巫女大人的生活与人身安全上，导致没有给自己任何活动时间，成为真正意义上的工具人，缺乏成为女主角的自信，只能时不时毒舌几句，再装作沉着冷静。所幸在神兽与男主的引导下，终于可以正视自己的内心，知道自己真正想要的是什么，终于可以想一个普通女孩一样活着了。

丛雨（CV：佐藤美柑）
本作的可爱担当。[spoiler]飞机场（误[/spoiler]为拯救苍生而甘愿献出自己生命的美少女。在寂寞的五百年间，看遍了沧海桑田，物是人非，唯有那一轮明月常相伴。虽有五百年的阅历，但是其身上依然保留了孩子气，内心胆小。幸运的是，五百年漫长的等待终于修成正果，取回自己的肉体，始于幼刀，终于幼刀，随着男主的插刀回石，丛雨终于完完全全成为了一个普通女孩，享受自己迟到了五百年的青春。


[h1]总结[/h1]
《千恋＊万花》是柚子社的集大成之作，本作的画面表现力生动，配乐独特而到位，各个女主都十分可爱，让人不禁“我全都要”，系统方便快捷，值得各个制作组学习。不过故事剧情还是略显平淡，没有太大的亮点。然而，作为一部游戏的废萌纯爱作品，又何必在意太多剧情呢，只要妹子可爱，糖发得够多不就完事了吗XD
最后，茉子天下第一！

千恋万花是由柚子社制作HIKARI FIELD, NekoNyan Ltd.联合发行的一款galgame，千恋万花应该是柚子社的超人气作品了，这次终于也是登录了steam，作为一款曾经获得过多项大奖的游戏，足以证明千恋万花拥有优秀的质量，也是得到了诸多玩家的青睐，而登陆steam之后的汉化质量也没让苦苦等待的柚子厨失望。

[h1]丛雨即出谁争锋，恋爱之甜息神怒[/h1]
[quote]
千恋万花的剧情依旧走的是柚子社比较擅长的日常向题材，这个游戏的风格几乎跟野良猫的剧情风格一模一样，都是微量的魔法元素本作就是崇神和丛雨，但其实质仍旧是日常向的故事，因为本作的除灵环节只占据了游戏的少部分剧情，这类剧情首先是男主一行人与崇神的战斗，最为集中的就是在第三章的末尾，第三章的末尾也是一个人物路线的分界点。打斗场面的文字描写对比战斗向的galgame还是差了许多，比如fate stay night本作文字的描写没能很好的体现出战斗的激烈程度，游戏的主力还是放在了日常描写上。

那么就回到这个游戏的的主干剧情吧，本作的剧情首先以男主回到了旷别已久的故乡开始，虽然是被自己的父母坑过去的，然后他在尝试拔刀的时候意外拔出了这个镇上无人能拔出的神刀丛雨，然后他就成为了丛雨的主人需要肩负起帮助本地被诅咒的朝武家，同时还要转学到这个小镇开始新的生活，同时寄住在本地的朝武家，就是在这一段时间里他们将擦出爱情的火焰。

本作的剧情说实在的话并没有让人有惊喜之感，因为这种回到故乡然后助人为乐的戏码不少galgame也都玩过了，所以本作依旧是套路框架下诞生的一部作品，比如隔壁的初音岛系列。综合来说这部作品的下限很高但是上限不高，无论是剧情的创意还是深度都达不到神作的要求，不过他依旧是一部超人气的作品。游戏的剧情虽然可能是套路化剧情但也没什么缺点，而且游戏的人物路线安排也非常不错。

本作有六条人物路线，以芳乃、茉子、蕾娜、丛雨的剧情为主，叙述手法上的精妙之处我觉得是这个游戏的一大亮点，首先四条路线的安排各有其用意，建议攻略的顺序是芳乃线放在第一个攻略，丛雨放在最后茉子和蕾娜看心情攻略。芳乃线里玩家会去消灭崇神，最后的决战里崇神被将臣完全消灭，两人过上了幸福的生活。虽然芳乃可能是本作的女一号毕竟有未婚妻加成但这条路线的节目效果反而是最差的，主要就是在第五章消灭崇神之后游戏就变成了一个纯粹的发糖故事，后期的剧情缺少了刺激之感。而茉子与蕾娜的剧情展开是我所没想到的，我本来以为这两个人物的路线会是完全的白开水但他们两个的人物路线却进行了崇神的背景补充，其中茉子的剧情线里她会被崇神附身从而了解他的愿望并不是诅咒他人，而是想了解何为人类的爱情，蕾娜线主要是补充崇神当时的遭遇还有蕾娜的身世，这也解开了为什么蕾娜身上会有崇神宿体的疑问。这两条路线都十分精彩，主要还是因为不平淡的日常直接延续到了六七章节，同时这两条路线的相对补充也丰富了崇神的人物形象，比单纯的杀死崇神要精彩许多。而丛雨线或者是幼刀线来说跟其他几个线都有不同，这个路线主要集中在了复兴小镇上，不过令我意外的是丛雨的过去仅仅局限与她自己的两句文字叙述，竟然没有任何的回想场景来探究她500年的过去，游戏也没有后日谈之类的设定，这一点我觉得实在可惜。而小春和芦花这两条路线纯粹是游戏的附属产品，也是最为纯粹的白开水，就是两个普通的恋爱故事，花的笔墨也最少。

其余的剧情都是极为漫长的日常剧情，日常还是本作主要描写的方面，日常方面没什么太过耀眼的地方，人物的成长性还算不错将臣在外公的锻炼之下有了明显的进步，而其他几位女主角的成长也格外明显，能做到这几点已经非常好了，巧妙的路线安排加上细致的日常描写使得这个游戏的下线比较高，但过于公式化的日常和恋爱也降低了这个游戏的上线，但博君一笑应该是不成问题的。

[h1]极其耀眼的人设[/h1]
[quote]
相比剧情我觉得本作的人设是这个游戏最为耀眼的部分，几个人物的形象泾渭分明各有其特点，其一手法就是游戏的another view环节主体视角的变换使得可以直接用文字叙述几位女主角的那种少女心思，比较便于读者了解女主角的内心活动。几位主角里我觉得最好的应该就是丛雨了，不仅仅是因为萝莉十分可爱，更在于她的那份天真烂漫。不过一个五百岁的人还能这么天真也有点不合理了，虽然游戏在丛雨回忆时也表现出的沧桑之感但也只是昙花一现。其他几个女主角的话身上都有共性，不如不擅长恋爱都是纸上谈兵，芳乃的话没什么常识甚至通过看少女漫画学习如何去谈恋爱，而茉子的话一直没有什么自信一直把自己当做一个配角，蕾娜一直都在努力的学习日本的知识心地善良甚至想帮助崇神。男主角将臣也拥有丰满的人物形象，有责任有担当也甘于拼搏，没有因为危险就一走了之而是不顾自身安全的去帮助他人。就是在日常的进程中几个主角的形象也逐渐的完善与升华，剧情决定了这个游戏的高下限，而出色的人设提高了整个游戏的上限。
[/quote]
[h1]高质量的人物CG与音乐[/h1]
[quote]
本作的CG数量非常多毕竟20多个小时的流程CG的数量也少不了，作为16年发售的游戏本作的CG画质非常高除了没有live2d那种动态效果之外也没什么缺点，不过值得吐槽的是本作有非常多的圣光画面，立绘与场景的搭配也非常到位，人物表情的变换和战斗时的立绘变化都十分不错。

游戏的音乐选用了比较合乎气氛的欢乐音乐，这个腿就不自觉的抖起来了，不过也有悲伤向的音乐，比如战斗和主角自我否定时的场景，但因为本作的目的并不是催泪所以也不是十分哀伤。
UI方面本作的功能还是挺多的，快速存档继续游戏选择支跳过应有尽有，为了方面玩家游玩整个游戏还设置了一个流程图，玩家可以跳转任何想要的剧情，这些功能也提高了玩家的游戏体验。
[/quote]
[h1]总结[/h1]
[quote]
千恋万花作为柚子社的高人气作品有着较高的下限，不过公式化的恋爱情节降低了整个游戏的上限，尽管游戏的人设格外出色也不能替代剧情的主体地位，游戏还是致力与让玩家感到欢乐，出色的叙事手法使得整个故事格外的精彩，优秀的音乐与画面也令人赞不绝口，高质量的汉化也让人读起来十分舒服。

DEATH STRANDING,schinese,"新颖且的富有冲击力的世界观，特立独行又意外有趣的玩法，电影级的动画表现，《死亡搁浅》与如今市面上公式化的套路游戏截然不同[spoiler]对，说的就是你，育碧[/spoiler]，其天马行空的想象力让玩家倍感惊喜。

[h1]连接人们的不仅是物流与网络，更是心[/h1]
在死亡搁浅发生后，城市毁灭，通信断绝，航空器失去作用，人们不得不重新通过人工来送货。然而城市之外除了有着加快一切物体时间流速的时间雨，伴随而来的更有亡者的本身，bt。曾经的武器失去作用，大量的前快递员——米尔人受开罗尔粒子的影响也变得疯狂，他们对一切都不在乎，除了自己曾经的本职。三五成群，抢夺一切他人的货物，对空手而来者视而不见。送货员们不得不面临高风险，也因此成为了人们心中的偶像。主角Sam，更是其中的佼佼者，被视为传奇。

人们之间缺乏交流，部分城市物资匮乏，更有极端的恐怖分子存在，也并不是所有人都对UCA敞开大门。在完成一个个的订单的过程中，我们重获信任，将一个个的节点连入网络，有点成片，自东向西，将人们重新团结在一起，共同面对未来。

[h1]要想稳，先修路[/h1]
安全区外，道路不存，高山、悬崖、石头地、河流与丛林，时间雨猝不及防，米尔人活动区比比皆是。上山搭梯，下山挂绳，临水架桥，即使我们解锁了载具，但面对复杂的道路环境，我们也是有苦难言。这时，公路铺设机与索道就是一个很好的选择。投入一定的材料，自动铺设，一段接一段，将点与点之间相连。驶上公路，不仅能不耗载具电量，更能避开危险区，全程又稳又快。注意公路上不耗电量的只有正中间。

建设需要大量的材料，但游戏另一大卖点则是玩家之间的共享。将新的区域并入开罗尔网络后即可解锁该地区的玩家设施，部分设施也需你解锁对应功能后才可看见。艰难跋涉时看见的架好梯子，湍急河流旁发现的一座桥，方便了自己更方便了他人，也别忘了对他人点赞以表感激。遗失货物能够寄存并委托其他玩家送货，缺乏装备也能够委托其他玩家运送，遭遇bt时更能有其他玩家出现相助，虽然我们彼此并不能看见，但我们都知道对方就在此处。

[h1]细节决定体验[/h1]
游戏在细节上的考虑也很多，鞋子会逐渐磨损，身体与衣物会因你路途中的经历而脏污，背负的货物也需要你考虑负重，运送途中更是需要注意重心是否有偏移。注意体力的消耗，及时补水，平衡身体以防跌倒或被水流冲走。BB压力过大会哭泣，甚至会因自身分泌的毒素而昏迷，应当及时安抚，这个过程中你还可以上下摇晃bb让他更快安眠。武器有弹药都有弹药数，车辆与道具都会破损，时间雨更会加速这个过程。因此当你在野外看见雨亭不妨稍作休整，雨亭也能自动修复货物包裹。刨除各种危险因素，送货过程中我们也能见证不同的秀美景色，当你接近目的地时，视角范围拉大，耳旁响起动听的bgm，一种成就感油然而生。

独特的世界观让人想去了解形成的背景，身上的谜题更是让玩家迫不及待的想去解开；过场动画大量，不亚于观看一场专门的电影，这也是《死亡搁浅》口碑不一的主要原因，但我认为，票价回本足矣，何妨一试。
